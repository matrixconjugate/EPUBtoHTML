The second time, the manufacturer replaced the disk drive again, along with the display screen and an unidentified checkbook-sized plastic board crammed with electronics. (All replaced parts were returned in a plastic bag with the computer.) The third time, a sharp, open-handed blow was delivered to the side of the computer near the base of the screen, at which point the computer resumed its normal operation. From then on, the recurring glitch was handled on-site without intervention from the manufacturer.</p><p>Everyone knows that whacking an electronic or mechanical device sometimes fixes it. And for a simple reason: malfunctions are often a matter of a loose or corroded electrical connection between two components, or a moving part that’s out of alignment, and a good bump that gets the innards randomly lurching may well restore the connection or alignment. It isn’t neat, but it can be perfectly effective. Even one scientist whose benchtop apparatus won him and a colleague a Nobel Prize in physics wasn’t too proud to occasionally give the equipment a gentle, therapeutic rap. Then again, scientists have good reason to appreciate the messy art of apparatus whacking. Disorder has been comfortably assimilated into, and in some cases made a central figure in, many branches of science.</p><p>There was once a time when the world embraced mess and disorder. Then mankind came along. Prehistoric man wouldn’t at first have been significantly less messy than most other animals. But over time, a preference for certain types of order must have conferred certain advantages in his fight for survival: a knack for categorizing mushrooms into poisonous and nonpoisonous varieties, for keeping hunting grounds free of human signs that would tip off prey, for storing precious tools and hides in one corner of the cave to enable fast packing and swift flight in case of emergency, to schedule shifts for guard duty. Archaeological sites dating as far back as 1.5 million years suggest that early hominids established caches of tools, and that by 20,000 BC some hunter-gatherers had separate areas for eating, cooking, tossing garbage, and even for leisure activities such as carving stones. Many anthropologists have argued that the Neanderthals, a species of man that branched off from <em>Homo sapiens</em>—us—a half million years ago and thrived in Europe for a hundred thousand years, died off because they seemed to show less of a proclivity for order than our own primitive ancestors, to judge by the unearthed remains of the messier Neanderthal sites.</p><p>The big jump in organization for the human species came with the transition from hunting and gathering to farming, given the latter’s requirements for long hours of hard work scheduled by day and by season, the arrangement of space to maximize production, the fencing in of animals, and the gathering and sorting of seeds and harvests. University of California at Los Angeles professor and well-known author Jared Diamond, for one, has questioned whether the whole agriculture thing was a smart move, pointing out that hunter-gatherers might have had it pretty good; today in Africa’s Kalahari Desert hunter-gatherers work fifteen hours a week, give or take, and spend most of the rest of the time sleeping and in leisure activities. Today in the United States, by contrast, many farmers sometimes work fifteen-hour days. On top of the work differential, farming societies throughout history have suffered the recurrence of famine, sometimes triggered in part by rigid farming routines that deplete soil and other resources. But for better or worse, mankind was off and running, from a neatness-and-order point of view.</p><p>With farming eventually came the rise of civilizations, all of them dependent on various forms of order—if considerably looser and in some cases far more brutal ones than those we know today—for getting things built, for containing crime, for mediating social affairs, for trade, and more. And with civilization came a societal elite who could demand more opulent and decidedly neater digs for themselves and their courts, even while the vast majority of the population continued to live in, as well as work in, the dirt. But privilege was also often associated with extremes of mess, as for example in the gorging, orgies, and blood sports of ancient Rome.</p><p>Great organized religions arose to impose order on an otherwise vague conception of the world, and to mitigate, at least in perception, the sometimes cruel randomness of life’s events. The very first thing we learn in the Bible, for example, is that God is the ultimate professional organizer:</p><p class="ext1">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</p><p class="ext3">And the earth was without form, and void...and God divided the light from the darkness....And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament....And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear....And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years....And God said, Let us make man in our image...male and female created he them. And...God said unto them...have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</p><p class="spb">After the Jews are brought into the desert in Exodus, Leviticus details an exhaustive list of rules, followed by Numbers, which is essentially a thorough audit of the Israelites. Much of the Old Testament is, in fact, taken up with the sort of listy, prescriptive and proscriptive material that might have found its way into an ancient version of <em>Organizing for Dummies.</em></p><p class="p3">Disorder’s reputation took a big hit with Christianity, much of it related to the fact that early church leaders were not keen on diversity of thought in their flocks. Around AD 100, the bishop Ignatius warned the community this way:</p><p class="ext1">It is therefore befitting that you should in every way glorify Jesus Christ, who hath glorified you, that by a unanimous obedience “ye may be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment, and may all speak the same thing concerning the same thing....” [Corinthians] Thus...do ye, man by man, become but one choir....</p><p class="spb">This sentiment is the forerunner of the claim, advanced today by many a religious, government, and business institution, that to do or say anything other than exactly what the institution specifies is to be sacrilegious, unpatriotic, or other than a team player, respectively. (As a bonus, Ignatius also took the trouble to specify that Satan suffered from a “stench” problem, which must have suggested to many an association between evil and garbage.) The church went on to invest much energy in categorizing offenses, especially sexual ones, by their seriousness, enabling a uniform code of punishment for them that became widely accepted in Ireland, England, Germany, and France in the latter half of the first millennium. Oral sex between males required up to twenty-two years’ penance, for example—triple the sentence assigned an impoverished woman who murdered her infant. (Of course, the Kama Sutra also categorized sexual acts, though its authors saw no need for the punishment part.) Alexander Pope would later state the church’s attitude toward disorder more succinctly, “Order is Heaven’s first law,” as quoted at the start of the chapter. A spine so badly twisted that it left him standing four foot six was apparently not enough to inspire Pope to wonder whether God is really all that big a stickler for neatness.</p><p class="p3">Aversion to mess eventually began to wend its way into the components of daily life. In the thirteenth century, the German knight and minstrel Tannh㴳er, who may be the first neat freak of record, spelled out in verse what fertile territory lay before order-minded reformers of the day:</p><p class="ext">A man of refinement should not slurp from the same spoon with somebody else....</p><p class="ext">A number of people gnaw a bone and then put it back in the dish—this is a serious offense.</p><p class="ext">A man who clears his throat when he eats and one who blows his nose in the tablecloth are both ill-bred, I assure you.</p><p class="ext">If a man wipes his nose on his hand at table because he knows no better, then he is a fool, believe me.</p><p class="ext">It is not decent to poke your fingers into your ears or eyes, as some people do, or to pick your nose while eating. These three habits are bad.</p><p class="ext">Refrain from eating with both hands.</p><p class="p3">In the 1523 tract <em>Diversoria,</em> the Dutch theologian Desiderius Erasmus named several more table-side outrages, describing a German inn this way:</p><p class="ext1">Some eighty or ninety people are sitting together, and it is stressed that they are not only common people but also rich men and nobles, men, women and children, all mixed together. And each is doing what he or she considers necessary. One washes his clothes and hangs the soaking articles on the stove....Garlic smells and other bad odors rise. People spit everywhere. Someone is cleaning his boots on the table....Everyone dips their bread into the general dish, bites the bread and dips it in again. The place is dirty, the wine bad....Everyone is sweating and steaming and wiping themselves....There are doubtless many among them who have some hidden disease.</p><p class="spb">Thus did Erasmus beat out <em>Seinfeld</em> by nearly five centuries in his condemnation of double dipping.</p><p>The fact that Tannhäer and later Erasmus felt a need to rail about such habits suggests that they were prevalent and that meals were often occasion for happy and innocent nose-picking, soup-spoon sharing, and bone replacing. Perhaps if it weren’t for those two visionaries of neatness, and of course for many others after them who gave voice to similar admonishments, meals would still be so today.</p><p>While religion was continually clamping down on messy thinking, science had a few things to say about order in the world as well. In Greece in the second century, Ptolemy put forth his model of the universe, with the Earth at its center, surrounded by nested, perfectly spherical shells in which were embedded the sun, moon, stars, and planets—the latter mounted on minispheres that added yet more motion to the contraption, needed to square it with observation. It was excruciatingly elaborate, highly ordered, and brooked no variation, making it just the sort of thing that a divine universe-builder would construct. Never mind that no amount of tweaking enabled the model to exactly match observation. What mattered was that the model was satisfying in its intelligent-designer feel, its uncompromising symmetry, and its seemingly biblical Earth-centricity. The church, not surprisingly, was distressed when, in the early seventeenth century, Galileo and others became too prominent in their support of the almost deplorably simple sun-centered model published by Copernicus in 1543, and modified in 1609 by the German astronomer Johannes Kepler.</p><p>But the church, as it turned out, had relatively little to fear, at least in terms of messiness, from the suddenly burgeoning scientific insights of the Renaissance. The new model of the solar system, when considered more carefully, seemed to hint not at a less carefully ordered universe but, rather, one that was even <em>more</em> ingenious in its construction. The world, it appeared, adhered to a series of immutable laws that, while subtle, could yet be cracked to show how all was divinely planned and organized. Instead of writing Latin tracts on the number of angels that could dance on the head of a pin, learned men could enlist a new tongue to tease out the heartbreakingly neat gear work of the universe. Or as Kepler put it, “The chief aim of all investigations of the external world should be to discover the rational order and harmony which has been imposed on it by God and which He revealed to us in the language of mathematics.”</p><p>Isaac Newton unveiled in the late seventeenth century what seemed to be the bulk of these laws, revealing a perfectly regulated clockwork universe whose components were fashioned from matter, gravity, and light. Europe soon became obsessed with actual clockwork, as precision engineering made possible timepieces with second-per-week accuracy. Now mortals, whether dandified socializers, captains of commerce, or dour Puritans scornful of wasted time, could reliably enjoy the same sort of unfailing organization that characterized the doings of the divinely efficient cosmos itself. The sentiment even took hold across the ocean in some quarters of the nascent United States. “Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions,” advised Benjamin Franklin, an early advocate for the highly effective. Franklin practiced what he preached, assiduously avoiding, for example, the time-wasting habit of interacting with his wife and son for much of his life.</p><p class="h1">Taylor Made</p><p class="p1">Franklin aside, the United States in its early years held promise as a proud bastion of disorder. To some extent, it owed its independence to the sheer messiness of its ragtag, highly improvisational military efforts, which were nearly guerilla in comparison to the rigid formation fighting of the snazzily dressed British units. The fractious structure of the nation, as hacked out by a turbulent Continental Congress, seemed to invite mess, setting up as it did an endless tension between the three branches of the federal government and between the federal government and the states. The United States started off with a highly ordered, tightly regulated financial system architected by Alexander Hamilton, but Thomas Jefferson soon razed it, preferring to leave monetary control to the whims of the market rather than to the designs of large banks and regulators. As the industrial revolution took hold in Britain and then spread through Europe at the end of the eighteenth century, the United States, whose farms employed three out of four Americans, became determined to catch up. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the United States was leading the world in the invention of new machines. The rapidly increasing mechanization of labor and the rise of factories created pervasive new forms of mess. One was pollution, as factories proved well suited to spewing filth of every sort wherever it was convenient to do so. Another was traffic, caused by the pull of cities on what had been a primarily rurally situated population, and by the dense flow of raw materials and goods between companies. But in some ways, it was a third, more subtle form of factory-related mess that would ultimately prove the most frustrating and anxiety-producing, especially to Americans. The thriving, machine-driven economy made so many goods affordable that for the first time in history a significant percentage of the population could afford to have enough stuff to make finding a place for it all a challenge. Technology’s growing sophistication would only continue to exacerbate the situation. According to a study conducted by the Gartner Group, Americans place 133,000 PCs in the trash every day.</p><p>As companies became more specialized and complex, they started striving to be more organized, and toward the end of the nineteenth century some people became expert in helping them do it. Library-book-categorization inventor Melvil Dewey—who had changed the spelling of his first name from the letter-wasting “Melville” with which his parents had saddled him—was a tireless promoter of efficiency tools ranging from shorthand to preprinted business forms. Edwin Seibels invented what we now know as the filing cabinet, complete with tabbed file folders to replace the awkward practice of organizing and storing documents by rolling them up and sticking them in pigeonholes in a desk or cabinet. Henry Gantt created a chart-based system for precisely scheduling a number of overlapping tasks. And Europe was not without its contributors to the growing order-mania in industry: Frenchman Henri Fayol codified the responsibilities of the manager, namely to plan, organize, command, coordinate, and control. But even these bold innovators were utterly eclipsed by the far more formidable figure of Frederick Taylor who, in the opening years of the twentieth century, conducted exhaustive studies of the way laborers went about their work at the Bethlehem Steel Company in Pittsburgh. The resulting 1911 book, <em>The Principles of Scientific Management,</em> would not only incite the business world once and for all to declare mess and disorder mortal enemies but would also indirectly do much the same for all of society.</p><p>Taylor, who at the age of twelve had started strapping himself into a harnesslike device of his own design at night in an effort to tame the nightmares that would plague him throughout his life, argued in his book that while industry had done a fair job of maximizing the efficiency of its machinery, it had neglected a weak link: the human worker, or as he put it, the “awkward, inefficient, or ill-directed movements of men.” Just as Newton’s laws of motion had seemingly provided a means to predict and thus in theory control the exact behavior of any physical system in any situation, so Taylor believed the seemingly messy process of human effort could be deconstructed and made orderly. By studying, measuring, and recording every element of every manual task with a stopwatch and a notebook, managers could calculate standardized procedures for every step that every worker must follow every time for maximum output. “The best management is a true science,” Taylor wrote, “resting upon clearly defined laws, rules, and principles as a foundation....It is only through enforced standardization of methods, enforced adoption of the best implements and working conditions, and enforced cooperation that this faster work can be assured.” Presented with a straightforward and low-cost means for boosting productivity—that Taylor’s methods quickly increased output were indisputable—U.S. industry and soon European companies as well threw themselves into “scientific management” practices that sought to stamp out variation and happenstance. In 1914, just three years after the publication of Taylor’s book, sixty-nine thousand people showed up for a Taylorism-inspired “efficiency exposition” in New York’s Grand Central Palace. Needless to say, Henry Ford’s pioneering development of the assembly line, which enabled the cheap production of millions of identical items, owed much to Taylor.</p><p>The suggestion that Taylor’s methods might find a place in child rearing was absurd enough to delight readers of the bestselling 1948 novel <em>Cheaper by the Dozen</em>—made into a hit movie in 1950 (and to which the more recent Steve Martin vehicle bears almost no resemblance)—in which the goofily rigid father of twelve children applies Taylor-style efficiencies to household tasks to comic effect. But many fans of the book and movie might be surprised to learn that it’s not a fictional tale. The book was written by two of the children who were brought up in exactly this fashion, and there was little funny about it at the time. The father was Frank Gilbreth, a professional Taylor disciple who really did believe that forcing a detailed, pervasive, unbending standardization of behavior was as appropriate for his kids as it was for the laborers under his influence. Taylor trained the family via whistle and stopwatch to assemble within six seconds. The children were required to track their weight, homework, and chores via chart—only prayer was exempt—and had to bathe with a few quick strokes of soap while listening to French or German gramophone recordings. Conversation involving subjects other than math or current events was banned at the dinner table, and family meetings were governed by <em>Robert’s Rules of Order.</em> The shorter girls dusted the lower half of the furniture, the taller girls the upper half. Eleven of the children were subjected to a mass tonsillectomy, which Gilbreth tried to film as a tool for speeding up surgeons. Gilbreth himself tried shaving with two razors at once but wounded himself so badly he reluctantly abandoned the effort. One of his sons would later recall that what bothered his father about the incident was not slashing his throat, but having to waste two minutes of his day stanching the bleeding.</p><p>Though Frank Gilbreth is the only person to become well known for it, part of a generation of parents became caught up in the Taylorian efficiency craze—even though Sigmund Freud and others studying the new science of the unconscious were warning about the sorts of pathological compulsions that could stem from the overly rigid treatment of young children. And parents weren’t the only ones outside the business world swept up by Taylorism. A group of Protestant churches in New York established a “church efficiency committee.” <em>Engineering Magazine</em> reported on complaints of insufficiently rapid witness questioning at a criminal trial relating to an incident in which twenty people had been killed. Politicians sung efficiency’s praises. Japan sent teams of experts to the United States and Europe to study modern, efficient practices and enthusiastically imported them; they later spread through much of Asia.</p><p>Strict Taylorism was ultimately discredited in the eyes of most experts in the late 1920s by a series of studies conducted at the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company. These studies clearly demonstrated that worker output improved when <em>any</em> change was introduced to the work environment or processes. This sort of improvement, now known as the <em>Hawthorne effect,</em> is simply due to the fact that people tend to try harder when they know they’re being observed. Worker output improved no more under a Taylor-style regimen than it did under clearly meaningless changes, such as lowering the lights or turning them up, so long as management was standing there to record the results. But while the wild enthusiasm for strict Taylorism faded, what never quite disappeared was a now-ingrained inclination to organize, schedule, arrange, and standardize at work, home, and everywhere else, as a means of squelching variation, improvisation, unpredictability, and anything that smacked of extraneousness.</p><p class="h1">Einstein’s Theory of Mess</p><p class="p1">In 1905, a twenty-six-year-old Swiss patent clerk unknown to the science community submitted five papers to scientific journals for publication. One of them spelled out a so-called theory of relativity, setting our concept of space and time on its ear. A second introduced the equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>, which would lead to the development of the atomic bomb and nuclear power. A third explained how light could behave more like a billiard ball than a wave, which paved the way for quantum mechanics, now the central theory of all of physics, and which, along with relativity, supplanted Newton’s far less messy laws. Can you name the subject addressed by either of the other two papers? If not, don’t feel bad. The editors of the<em> New York Times</em> apparently couldn’t do any better, judging by the fact that they omitted them from a time line of Albert Einstein’s contributions published to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of his “miracle year.” Perhaps they and many others would be surprised to learn that according to a recent study, one of these two often-overlooked papers has actually proved more influential to science than the other, more famous, three. In fact, the study, which, per science-community convention, counted the number of times papers were cited by other scientists in their own published papers, reckoned this work to be the most influential paper in all of modern science.</p><p>The paper addressed the phenomenon known as <em>Brownian motion.</em> In 1827, the scientist Robert Brown peered at a drop of water through a microscope and saw that tiny grains of pollen in the drop seemed to be jerking around as if they were alive. For more than seventy-five years, this widely observed motion remained an utter mystery to science, and a conspicuous one. Einstein solved it. In the paper, he reasoned that if matter was made of molecules—bear in mind that as of 1905 there had never been any clear evidence that this was true—and if the molecules were randomly bouncing around as would be expected in a liquid, then once in a while, just by chance, more of these molecules would bounce into one side of a grain of pollen in the liquid than would bounce into the opposite side, causing the grain to lurch. Thus, over time the grain would be expected to jerk here and there, as excesses of molecules randomly hit the grain, first on one side and then on another. Einstein whipped up some tricky math to calculate what sorts of arrangements of molecules might provide the random hits needed to produce the observed pollen jerking and, in this way, gave the world its first look, if an indirect one, at the molecular structure of matter. (The fifth paper Einstein published in 1905 used a different approach to deduce the size of molecules.)</p><p>An explanation of dancing pollen probably doesn’t strike you as the sort of thing that would climb to the top of the all-time science hit parade. The understanding of matter’s structure was a revelation, but that by itself isn’t what ended up making the paper so important. It has more to do with Einstein’s insight that purely random activity on the part of many little things could produce striking and important behavior on the part of bigger ones. As it turns out, this sort of interesting randomness-fed behavior shows up almost everywhere scientists look. And the mathematical technique Einstein cobbled together to analyze the behavior, a technique now called <em>Brownian motion theory,</em> has proved so effective that a number of universities worldwide have entire departments whose members do little else but study new ways to apply Brownian motion theory and its offshoots to the world around us. This research, and still other approaches centered on randomness—which is often referred to by scientists as <em>fluctuations, noise,</em> and <em>stochastics</em>—has become critical to understanding how financial markets work, how the galaxies formed, how electronic devices function, how ecosystems thrive, and how genes work. More than a dozen Nobel Prizes have been awarded for randomness-related research. (<em>Friendly reminder:</em> None of this has anything to do with chaos theory. Chaotic systems aren’t about randomness—they actually tend to be highly ordered.) In fact, randomness is thoroughly inescapable in nature, if for no other reason than the fact that quantum mechanics holds that every elementary particle in the universe is subject to deeply random behavior at every instant in time. The very birth of the universe itself is thought by physicists to have been a <em>quantum fluctuation,</em> a sort of random hiccup in reality.</p><p>Over the past decade, the respect accorded randomness by scientists has climbed to an entirely new level, thanks to a once-obscure phenomenon known as <em>stochastic resonance.</em> In a nutshell, stochastic resonance applies to a paradoxical-sounding situation in which adding some sort of randomness to a system makes it more effective—as if the more static you picked up on a radio station, the more clearly you heard the music. (Which isn’t far from the truth.) Though the phenomenon was first proposed in the early 1980s, it wasn’t until the early 1990s that scientists began to recognize how frequently it turns up in nature, in everything from climate changes to evolution. Now there are tens of thousands of papers published every year on stochastic resonance and its applications. A number of them focus on a particular system that many believe to be especially reliant on the phenomenon as a critical element of its functioning: the brain.</p><p>In other words, as managers, homemakers, and just about everyone else were becoming increasingly determined throughout much of the twentieth century to bring more order to every facet of their lives and environments, an enormous body of evidence was accumulating in the scientific community to support the claim that not only is disorder integral to the fabric of nature, but adding more of it can sometimes <em>improve</em> things.</p><p class="h1">What Is Mess? (Redux)</p><p class="p1">Chapter 1 laid out a simple, intuitive notion of what mess is. Now it’s time to spell out a few things.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Mess Isn’t Necessarily an Absence of Order</strong> Often a system is messy to some extent because of the lack of one specific type of order, even though other forms of order are present in abundance. Thus, a room might be uncluttered but noisy, with people running in and out of it. What’s more, mess often arises from a <em>failed</em> order rather than from an absence of order. You could fill a room with all sorts of neat bins and cabinets for storing things, but if the bins and cabinets overflow, you’ve got a mess. Most messes encountered in daily life are failed orders—someone had an organizing scheme in mind, but for one reason or another it didn’t work.</p><p class="h2"><strong>The Types of Mess</strong></p><p class="spb"><em>Clutter:</em> Elements scatter out, often prolifically, from normally accepted positions.</p><p class="spb"><em>Mixture:</em> Elements are randomly ordered or otherwise atypically combined within normally accepted positions.</p><p class="spb"><em>Time sprawl:</em> Tasks and events are scheduled loosely or not at all or are left somewhat unprioritized; or intended priorities are ignored, as in the case of procrastination.</p><p class="spb"><em>Improvisation:</em> Processes, tasks, and events aren’t predetermined.</p><p class="spb"><em>Inconsistency:</em> Processes and procedures change frequently. If the changes are arbitrary, they tend to lead to greater levels of mess, but reasoned changes can still be quite messy.</p><p class="spb"><em>Blur:</em> Categorization schemes are kept loose, are often ignored, or both. Any degree of vagueness might contribute to blur, though vagueness could just as well fit into the category of <em>convolution</em> (below).</p><p class="spb"><em>Noise:</em> Processes and information are exposed to a possibly disruptive, but not necessarily random, outside influence.</p><p class="spb"><em>Distraction:</em> Focus wanders between different elements.</p><p class="spb"><em>Bounce:</em> Activity levels are higher than is strictly necessary and customary and tend to be unpredictable.</p><p class="spb"><em>Convolution:</em> Organizational schemes are eccentric and opaque, as when they are dependent on intuition or are in some way illogical.</p><p class="spb"><em>Inclusion:</em> Relatively few filters are in effect to restrict the number and type of entities in the system; or a particular filter is absent, allowing in an entity normally excluded. </p><p class="spb"><em>Distortion:</em> An entity is misaligned, bent, stretched, broken, decayed, displaced, marred, or otherwise presents in other-than-standard condition.</p><p>These descriptions also imply corresponding descriptions of types of neatness and order. Specifically:</p>

</table><p class="spb"><strong>The Width, Depth, and Intensity of Mess</strong> A mess is <em>wide</em> if it involves multiple groups or layers, as for example several rooms in a house or different departments in a company. A mess is <em>deep</em> if many entities in a single group or layer are involved in the mess, as for example a month’s worth of laundry scattered across a single room. A mess is <em>intense</em> if, for a given number of entities, the level of disorder is especially high or potentially painful, as for example if a driver in Las Vegas takes a few wrong turns and ends up lost thirty miles out in the middle of the desert.</p><p class="spb"><strong>The Scale of Mess</strong> The type, width, depth, and intensity of mess can all vary in a single system at a given time, depending on the scale at which you consider the system. Thus, a neighborhood of filth-caked, misaligned buildings and cars parked helter-skelter might appear messy, but the apartments inside each building might be pristine.</p><p class="spb">Having a little historical context and a broader understanding of the nature of mess will come in handy as we explore some of the surprising roles that mess can play in our lives and in the workings of the world—and why disorder is not always the villain it’s been made out to be. In fact, sometimes a <em>lack</em> of disorder can be dysfunctional. Remember the two decks of cards from chapter 1? As it turned out, you could find four random cards much more quickly in a shuffled deck once you properly accounted for the time it took to order the other deck. But here’s another point to consider about an ordered deck of cards: What’s it good for? Of all the things in all the world that are done with decks of cards, few require an ordered deck of cards. The first thing you do with an ordered deck of cards is <em>shuffle</em> them. It’s not just that disordered decks require less work to maintain; they’re much more useful. The usefulness of mess isn’t so rare a thing as you might think, as we’re about to see.</p></div></body></html>
