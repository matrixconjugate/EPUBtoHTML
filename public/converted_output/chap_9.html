Paris circa 1850 exemplified this unconstrained, disordered approach to urban development. Almost an M. C. Escher maze of cramped alleys and skewed rows of apartment buildings, the dizzyingly disorganized city yet managed to harbor notable parks, palaces, monuments, and museums, not to mention holding a worldwide reputation as one of civilization’s cultural and social apexes. But growing annoyed with the ubiquitous crowds, the traffic bottlenecks, the lack of sewers, and the slums, among other features of Parisian life, Napoleon III authorized Baron Georges-Eug筥 Haussmann in 1853 to straighten out the big mess. The personally hyperfastidious Haussmann embarked on a half-billion-franc urban makeover that included essentially razing the heart of Old Paris and taking down or refashioning some 60 percent of the city’s buildings, forcing much of the less affluent population to migrate out. He slashed a dozen broad, long, straight boulevards into the city in the form of spokes radiating from the Arc de Triomphe, intended both to provide grand views of various landmarks and to demarcate and physically separate neighborhoods, slicing the city into twenty arrondissements. When it was all over, Haussmann had provided a new paradigm for generations of European and American urban planners to come. The designer city: a vast, three-dimensional work of art to which a population—or at least the subset of the population with sufficient taste and means—could happily accommodate itself.</p><p><em>Plus ça change,</em> sighs Joel Kotkin, a feisty and amiably cranky expert on the growth of U.S. cities and a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, a public-policy think tank. Kotkin says Haussmann’s artisto-intellectual descendants today find some expression in New Urbanism, a movement that picked up steam in the New Economy of the late 1990s and continues strongly despite the bursting of that bubble. New Urbanists argue for cities that each have a dense urban core serving as an engine of attraction, thanks to stylish apartment buildings; bustling business centers jammed not with shipping docks and smokestacks but with advertising agencies, telecommunications consulting firms, and other employers of “the creative class”; and most important to pedestrian-oriented designer alleys lined with coffeehouses, bookstores, restaurants, and art galleries. Surrounding this bustling core, say New Urbanists, should be outer “rings” of suburbs and exurbs dedicated to vast crops of apartment buildings, town houses, and houses, connected to the city’s attractions by light rail lines that radiate like spokes from the core.</p><p>This neat, highly ordered conception of the city, which has influenced urban planning in Boston, Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, and many other U.S. cities, is perfect, says Kotkin. Perfect, that is, if you’re anything like the sort of people who become experts in urban design and follow movements like New Urbanism. By which Kotkin means advanced-degreed professionals who love hip, urban life—New Urbanists pass the word <em>hip</em> around like a holiday confection—and who are relatively affluent, cultured, design conscious, work focused, craving of high stimulation, and as likely to take root in ideas as in places. They are also inclined to start families later in life and keep them small, if they have children at all. In other words, urban designers tend to want to make cities over in their own image. “They’re building ephemeral cities for the nomadic rich,” as Kotkin puts it.</p><p>What a dense, stylish urban environment and its predominantly residential outer rings do not provide, says Kotkin, are what most of the 36 percent of Americans who are currently raising children, plus the tens of millions more who help raise or plan to raise children, want: single-family houses, with enough land for a wildflower meadow (all right, a lawn), that are reasonably close to jobs, shopping, and entertainment. Such homes could in principle be located in the innermost ring of a New Urbanism–designed city, but only at an enormous premium, because competition to live near the richly endowed core will always be fierce and apartment buildings will hold sway. The vast majority of house owners will be relegated far into the outer rings, a long train ride from the resources that are the point of the New Urbanism exercise. Indeed, the U.S. cities that New Urbanists point to as the most livable are the very ones that seem to be driving families out. San Francisco has the lowest under-eighteen population percentage of any big city in the United States, about 15 percent. Less than 23 percent of households in Boston and Atlanta include children under age eighteen. In Seattle, children are outnumbered by dogs. Portland, Oregon, has hit its lowest level of children in eighty years. San Jose has been closing schools each year. “We’ve moved from stigmatizing people without children to celebrating them,” says Kotkin.</p><p>A better model of a city for the family oriented—that is, for the people who carry out much of the actual living in and around cities rather than planning them—would be to take the New Urbanism core and all its rings, add more houses and a wider range of businesses, and throw them into a big shaker to undo all that planning and order. Pouring out of the shaker would be a rambling, widely varied blend of villagelike clots of semisuburbia snuggled right up against urbanlike clots of businesses and apartment buildings. What America needs, says Kotkin, is more sprawling, mixed, blurred, disorganized cities. What America needs is more cities like Los Angeles.</p><p>Kotkin lives in the Valley Village section of Los Angeles, a sea of small but pleasant houses pierced along a few axes by strings of strip malls. Strip malls are the b鳥 noire of city planners, but Kotkin has some affection for them. L.A. strip malls, he says, are microversions of the New Urbanism city core, made affordable and geographically accessible to families and reflecting a broad range of tastes and ethnic identities. As an example, he points out a restaurant near his home that offers a clever blend of Japanese and American food amid eccentric decor. There’s no long wait for a table, it’s reasonably priced, and you won’t find many like it anywhere else, Kotkin says, though you’ll find some sort of unique strip-mall restaurant in neighborhoods throughout L.A., along with office buildings, warehouses, and machine shops. Strip malls and micro–industrial parks may not be stylish or lovely, but they nicely meet the needs of local residents in far-flung neighborhoods.</p><p>What’s more, notes Kotkin, Los Angeles’s disorder exists on multiple scales. Studding the city’s minivillage landscape without much rhyme or reason are bigger chunks of urban and suburban development, ranging from a modest sky-scrapered downtown area to genteel Bel-Air to the Lincoln Heights barrio to carnivalesque Venice, along with pockets of culture both high and pop, ranging from the Getty Museum to Universal CityWalk—a cartoonish, family-oriented parody of a New Urbanism city core. Getting around via the city’s dense maze of roads is perhaps not much easier than it was to get through Paris 160 years ago, but that reflects the wide, disorganized distribution of L.A.’s resources and attractions. “Life is unstructured, and a lot of it is best discovered just driving around,” Kotkin says.</p><p>To design out this sort of messiness, says Kotkin, is to cut out the hearts and souls of cities and replace them with something that’s clever and appealing but that ultimately fails to resonate with most of the population. The drive to create ordered urban utopias comes not from the public at large, he says, but from what he calls “the chattering class”—academics, journalists, and highly paid consultants who have something to gain from the notion that cities need to be carefully thought out and planned. This is an unexpected gibe from someone who, having held fellowships at Pepperdine and other universities and having written several books and innumerable magazine articles, has committed more than his share of chattering, but Kotkin notes that his own chattering must be of a different sort, given how frequently he’s been vilified in print and elsewhere by his fellow chatterers. Besides which, he adds, he has only a high school degree. In any case, the most discouraging resistance he gets is from his current students at the Southern California Institute of Architecture, most of whom are irrepressibly eager to impose their designs on the canvas of a disordered city. “They all want to be Haussmanns,” he says.</p><p>Kotkin can always point out that Haussmann was fired by Napoleon III in 1870. Not only had the financial cost of Haussmann’s massive makeover proved a painful burden, but Parisians by and large keenly missed their sprawling, messy city.</p><p class="spb">Mess and disorder, and our biases against them, are woven into the fabric of society. The ways in which we as individuals and institutions forge relationships, achieve advantages, fight, protect ourselves, help each other, communicate, govern ourselves, heal ourselves, assemble our infrastructures—all this and more is modified, compromised, and enriched by the degree and types of disorganization tolerated in each instance. The role of disorder in any one of these areas could be the subject of many chapters, so this tour of mess “politics”—to employ the term in its broadest possible meaning—will by necessity be selective and superficial. But even a smattering of examples will show that just as people and organizations are messy and ordered to different extents and in different ways, so too are cities and nations.</p><p class="h1">Mess Around the World</p><p class="h2"><strong>The United States</strong></p><p class="p1">Americans like to think of themselves as being a diverse, freethinking, and independent lot, and of the United States as a nation unburdened by excessive political and social order. It’s true that the United States can fairly be called a blended nation, thanks to a history largely dominated by immigration from around the world. Even those who take the trouble to trace their ancestry back to the Pilgrims are defining themselves through their immigrant roots. Home of the pizza bagel, America offers a vivid mix of ethnic identities that provides a sort of national ethnic metaidentity in its own right, and holds open opportunity and mobility where many other countries fall into categorization by socioeconomic classes.</p><p>On the other hand, the United States works awfully hard these days to keep people out of the country. A 2005 survey by scientific research society Sigma Xi revealed that nearly 60 percent of postdoctoral scholars at U.S. universities who aren’t U.S. citizens have had trouble getting back into the United States after traveling outside the country. This despite the fact that foreign postdocs may be the best value in our workforce. The survey indicates that they work longer hours and are paid less than their already hardworking, low-paid U.S. counterparts, while publishing 30 percent more of the sort of high-powered, innovative, technical and scientific research that helps drive the U.S. economy. And where the government leaves off in its efforts to squelch the influx of global blood into the country, others are prepared to take up the slack with enthusiasm, as witnessed by the Arizona-based Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, which recruits armed citizens to patrol the border with Mexico. According to a poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports, Americans are evenly split on whether this sort of thing is a good idea, leaving open the question of whether their reverence for independence and opportunity is better represented by the illegal immigrant struggling against the odds to find work or by the gun-packing vigilante eager to track him down as a hobby.</p><p>One of Americans’ proudest traits is a quickness to stand up to the sort of abusive authoritarianism often required to assert firm, consistent, uniform order over a people. The self-perception of this don’t-tread-on-me mentality was particularly reassuring after World War II, when U.S. psychologists lined up to explain that the German character contained a subservience that allowed strong-arming by a sociopath such as Hitler, whereas the American character clearly did not. Yale researcher Stanley Milgram set out to prove it in 1961 with an experiment in which an actor would instruct a subject to inflict increasingly severe “electric shocks”—the subject didn’t know the shocks were faked—to another person in the name of research into learning and memory. Milgram envisioned first demonstrating that Americans would shrug off such pathological guidance and refuse to electrocute an innocent victim, and then that just-following-orders Germans would readily get with the program. As it turned out, there was little point in going to Germany; every single one of the American subjects was successfully pushed into applying what he or she believed was a jolt of 300 volts, a level labeled “Danger: Severe shock,” to the screaming victim, and two-thirds of them continued to up the juice to an apparently lethal level of 450 volts when ordered to. In one variation of the experiment, a third of the subjects obeyed orders to physically force the victim’s hand into contact with the shock-delivering mechanism.</p><p>On a less gruesome note, but one that perturbs on a more constant basis, America shares with most developed countries a problem with noise pollution. Aural noise, at least to the extent that it’s random, is a form of mess, and can be highly distracting—though that’s not necessarily the problem in an inarguably and constantly noisy city like New York, since the brain is quite good at filtering out constant noise. The bigger problem is that as noise grows louder, it starts to become a health hazard. Times Square’s sustained decibel level of 89—one of the loudest found in any major city in the world—is regarded by experts as high enough that prolonged exposure can cause high blood pressure as well as threaten permanent damage to higher-frequency hearing. In 2004, Mayor Bloomberg openly declared war on New York’s noisiness; <em>New York</em> magazine made noise a cover story; and U.S. representative Nita Lowey, whose district borders the city on the north, helped spearhead an effort to pass federal noise restrictions on cities. But in the end, New Yorkers may actually have relatively little to whine about. The real cacophony in the United States isn’t from subways, traffic, jackhammers, and street vendors; it’s from tractors, combines, and threshers, so much so that three-quarters of farmers in the United States suffer from hearing loss. For them, a visit to New York City might be a chance to grab a little relative peace and quiet.</p><p class="h2"><strong>Germany</strong></p><p class="p1">Hans Rindisbacher, a professor at Pomona College outside of Los Angeles, was crossing an empty intersection on foot one night when a passerby on the sidewalk behind him started shouting angrily at him. “Are you color blind?” the man roared, pointing at the red DON’T WALK sign. Rindisbacher was momentarily taken aback—there was, after all, not a car in sight—but then remembered he was visiting Germany, where even minor transgressions of regulatory, business, and social conventions can lead to loud confrontations.</p><p>Germans often yell in public at perfect strangers, as well as at neighbors, over what they perceive as the flouting of proper order, says Rindisbacher, who grew up in German-speaking Switzerland and now specializes in German studies. You can expect to be dressed down by whoever happens to be near you for walking on the wrong path, ordering at the wrong window, or placing the wrong kind of trash in the wrong bin. This can be unsettling for visiting Americans, who back home might be annoyed at the fellow who slips into the twelve-items-or-less line with fourteen items, but typically would not criticize a stranger’s behavior out loud. Being a visiting foreigner who doesn’t know the ropes won’t win you much slack in Germany, either, notes Rindisbacher. In fact, he says, Germans tend to be even more expressively annoyed at the noncompliant behavior of people they perceive to be clueless outsiders.</p><p>Rindisbacher suspects that Germans’ outspokenness toward those who don’t do things a certain way dates back centuries to the tradition of guilds—organizations of craftsmen who kept tight control on the training and employment of workers in most fields, be it bricklaying or accounting. A career in a guild-dominated field meant first being taken on as an apprentice who could expect to be browbeaten for years by a demanding “master” intolerant of the slightest deviance from his meticulous techniques. Eventually, the apprentice would become a master expected to treat his own apprentices in exactly the same way. Though the guilds are long gone, their impact is still felt in Germany via powerful labor unions and a body of workers’ rights regulations that makes it exceedingly difficult for companies to fire or transfer a worker, let alone get them to do things differently. While looser, more dynamic American-style business practices are starting to take hold in Germany, says Rindisbacher, the how-dare-you-not-do-it-this-way culture is tough to kill and spills beyond the workplace.</p><p>The German expectation of order has also been associated with the peculiarities of the German language, which, unlike English, is a highly structured and consistent one with few exceptions in grammar, spelling, or pronunciation. English, for example, permits a certain amount of improvisation in how the parts of a sentence can be arranged, but German demands sticking the verb at the end of a sentence so that a listener or reader must sometimes wade through a long, complex parade of nouns, adjectives, and prepositions before finally getting to find out what the fuss is all about. Having to learn to speak in this somewhat rigid and ponderous fashion surely has an effect on how people think, or so the theory goes. Actually, this once widely accepted link between the German style of thinking and its language had fallen out of vogue over the past few decades, but it is being reasserted by scientists in the wake of brain-scan studies that seem to support the notion of strong language-thinking links.</p><p>There may be another language-related reason why Germans can be less tolerant of mess than others: they don’t really have a word for it. The closest is the word <em>unordnung,</em> which means “unorder,” but that leaves Germans able to think of mess only in terms of what it is not, rather than having a concept for mess as a condition in its own right. It’s like understanding <em>coolness</em> only as “unwarmth.” It may be harder to appreciate something when the only way to conceive of it is as the absence of something else, especially when that something else is generally cherished. Many English words and phrases that refer to mess-related concepts and processes are utterly untranslatable into German in any meaningful way, adds Rindisbacher. <em>Yard sale</em> is an example. Relatively few Germans have yards or garages, he notes, and if they did, they wouldn’t have hundreds of excess possessions with which to fill them, let alone expect others to buy them.</p><p>The strong brand of environmentalism one encounters in Germany also has a whiff of excess order to it, says Rindisbacher, particularly when it comes to recycling. A pile of undifferentiated trash feels to some like a form of uncomfortable lawlessness, in that it invites the close proximity of items that don’t normally belong together. “There’s nothing wrong with a piece of fruit, a pair of underpants, and a teddy bear, but if you throw them together then you have something awful,” he explains. “It violates the social order of everyday objects.” The sorting of trash required for recycling restores some of this order, he notes—and Germans, as a rule, recycle with zeal.</p><p>Germans aren’t less mess-friendly than Americans in all ways. For one thing, says Rindisbacher, they tend to be more relaxed than Americans about their work schedule, taking more breaks, lingering longer at social meetings, and knocking off sooner. They can also be highly innovative—especially when they’re expected to be, as in the case of automobile and other engineers. And when it comes to waiting in line, they are freewheeling to an extent that would appall most Americans, says Rindisbacher, often forming shapeless swarms beside cash registers, shouldering in front of each other, and walking around barriers intended to keep crowds queued. That’s not because they don’t respect the rules for lining up; it’s because there <em>aren’t any</em> widely accepted rules for lining up. Rather, everyone seems to have their own.</p><p>Incidentally, though Milgram was too horrified by his results with Americans to take his “shocking” experiment to Germany, other researchers performed it there and found that German subjects were 30 percent more likely than American subjects to administer to innocents what they believed were lethal levels of electricity.</p><p class="h2"><strong>France</strong></p><p class="p1">France has long taken an unusually ordered official view of the various ethnic variations among its citizens and permanent residents, and especially among immigrants. It has essentially maintained that such variations don’t, or at least should not, exist. In the United States and the United Kingdom, it would be unthinkable for the government to refuse to acknowledge the cultural and religious differences of its immigrants; these nations at least pay lip service to the benefits of diversity and have in many ways recognized the appropriateness of affirmative action. Germany and Austria tried to finesse the challenge of accommodating immigrants by allowing for two categories of resident: the full citizen and the “guest worker,” the latter category implicitly making room for the immigrant who might behave differently and have different needs, if at a cost of having to give up some rights and benefits. France, on the other hand, simply decreed that French citizenship confers a national identity that subsumes any other. As a result, the government not only refused to consider any special programs or allowances for immigrants who might face discrimination or other difficulties, it even refused to specifically survey immigrant populations or in any other way study the situation. The government did, however, take the trouble to regulate mosques—there are only six mosques with minarets in the country—and ban the wearing of religious head scarves in schools, moves that did not sit well with the country’s five million Muslims, nearly a tenth of the population. Many of them live in the poor neighborhoods that surround Paris, the contemporary embodiment of the first outer rings that originated when Haussmann’s makeover sent the poorer residents of Paris packing and left them disconnected from the city, and where today unemployment among workers under age twenty-five runs near 50 percent. It was, of course, these young Muslims who initiated more than two weeks of intense rioting, first around Paris and then all over France in 2005, shaking the country to its core and battering its image worldwide. That produced a serious mess, but apparently the suburban residents had long been considered messy anyway, at least by President Jacques Chirac, who in 1991 openly referred to the problem of “the noises and cooking smells” emanating from the homes of immigrants there.</p><p class="p3">Foreign visitors to Parisian parks are sometimes surprised to be accosted by a uniformed guard who brusquely tells them to get off the grass, or, if they have children, to remove them to another section of the park altogether, despite the absence of signs warning of any restrictions. The visitors are not being gratuitously harassed; they are being welcomed to an essential element of French society: assuming that something is prohibited until you have positively ascertained that it is not. Though the French are fairly maniacal about distributing garish red and white <em>INTERDIT</em>—“prohibited”—signs in every nook and cranny of the country, their numbers pale in comparison to the catalog of acts one must simply know are prohibited. Rollerblading in public, touching certain merchandise in stores, not having a passport or identification card on your person, running to catch a Metro, driving with your parking lights on during the day—these and countless other infractions can result in tickets, arrest, or forcible ejection from your immediate location. The French, for their part, find foreigners—and especially Americans—exceedingly childish in their petulance over being taken to task for not complying with any of a bewildering, unpredictable, and seemingly gratuitous multitude of odd restrictions. That’s because the French themselves are acclimated to the pervasive concept of <em>interdit</em> as preschool students. There are a number of children’s books dedicated to explaining to tots why the endless stream of <em>interdit</em>s they are already encountering is critical to the smooth functioning of society. Here’s how the book <em>Interdit, Toujours Interdit, Mais Pourquoi?</em> (Prohibited, Always Prohibited, but Why?) puts it:</p><p class="ext1">All around us and in our daily lives, it seems as if there isn’t anything that’s not prohibited. It’s enough to make you wonder if you have any rights at all! But actually, the prohibitions are essential, and there’s a bright side to them. What’s the point of all the prohibitions?...What would our lives be like if everything were allowed?</p><p class="spb">It’s a reasonable notion, up to a point. Children have to learn not to run out into the street or eat candy by the pound. But the idea that children must be conditioned to embrace a ubiquitous and often arbitrary array of restrictions imposed on every aspect of life seems a uniquely French one.</p><p>On the other hand, the French do make use of a colorful vocabulary of mess, including <em>pêle-mêle,</em> which the English language has borrowed as “pell-mell,” and especially <em>bordel,</em> or “brothel.” The latter is commonly employed with enthusiasm in the form of <em>“Quel bordel!”</em> and translates into English as “What a mess!” The French are not alone here. The use of words that mean brothel to also signify mess turns out to be nearly universal. The middle-Persian word <em>balakhaana,</em> which meant “an upper room,” eventually made it into Turkic and thence to Russian, Polish, Yiddish, Hebrew, and Lebanese, among several other Eastern European and Middle Eastern languages, in the form of <em>balagan,</em> which today is widely used to mean both “brothel” and “mess.” (All English got from the deal was the word <em>balcony.</em>) Meanwhile, the Old Indo-European word <em>bherdh,</em> or “wooden plank” and later “a shack,” became <em>bordel</em> in French, <em>burdel</em> in Polish, and <em>bardak</em> in Russian and Hebrew, again used to mean both “brothel” and “mess.” English ended up with <em>board,</em> though also <em>bordello,</em> which sometimes stands in for mess in the United Kingdom, but not in the United States. Italians use <em>casino,</em> literally “a small house,” to mean both “brothel” and “mess.” One can’t help wondering, in looking at this long-standing and widespread verbal intertwining of brothels and mess, if being messy didn’t at one time carry a more interesting and provocative aura.</p><p class="h2"><strong>Japan</strong></p><p class="p1">A midlevel manager at a U.S.-based subsidiary of Japanese industrial giant Fujitsu was brought to Japan to visit the home offices of his division and was taken to an enormous room of several dozen desks arrayed in a distinct and neat, if a bit asymmetrical, fashion. The desks, which had no partitions separating them, were all that served as offices for the division’s managers, a host explained to him. The manager was impressed that senior executives made do with the same office facilities as the most junior of employees, but also noticed that the higher-ranked managers were grouped on one side of the room and had more space around their desks. He suddenly realized that the desks were set up in exactly the arrangement of the division’s published organizational chart. Every time a manager arrived at work, glanced up from his desk, or got up to go to a meeting or the bathroom, he would be unambiguously reminded of where he stood in the organization. Still digesting this odd fact, the U.S. manager was whisked to a meeting of a dozen or so Japanese managers, presided over by a vice president. When a lively discussion sprang up over a proposed project, the vice president put his chin on his chest, closed his eyes, and soon started snoring audibly. Even more astonishing to the U.S. manager was the fact that no one else at the meeting seemed to find the snoozing worth noting. When the discussion died down, the vice president awoke, inquired about the results, gave his blessing to it, and ended the meeting. The manager learned later that the vice presidential nap wasn’t indicative of a lack of interest or a sleeping disorder, but was rather a common solution to a knotty management problem. In a society that insists on both group consensus and deep respect for the opinions of superiors, how can group decisions be reached at meetings without either excluding the boss or failing to defer to his opinion? Easy: the boss kicks off the meeting, falls asleep, and wakes up when consensus has been reached.</p><p>Japan is one of the most order-obsessed nations in the world, and keeping a society functioning in the face of all that rigid organization and neatness can require a fair amount of resourcefulness. Some of the order is by necessity. Thanks to high population density and urban real-estate costs, most families must make do with tiny apartments. But with affluence comparable to that of Americans, Japanese families typically have a great many items to stuff into their small space. To avoid a genuine clutter crisis, Japanese often sleep on beds that are rolled up and put away in the morning, maintain storage areas under their floors and in their ceilings, and in general keep things in their place. They are also quicker to get rid of old possessions to make room for the new, and since buying other people’s used items is considered a bit crass, the only option is simply to trash them. As a result, the curbs of Japanese streets are often piled with some pretty nice “junk.” Japanese trash in many towns is further neatened by draconian trash-sorting requirements that include up to forty-four different categories of items that must be kept separate, such as chopsticks and bottle caps. Those who mix up steel cans with aluminum ones or who fail to wash and dry their used handkerchiefs before trashing them can expect to receive stern written warnings from trash-prowling volunteers who can, in some cases, get repeat offenders evicted from their homes.</p><p>The adherence to order in Japan sometimes seems irrational. Some parking garages won’t accept motorcycles, simply because they’re not cars. On a Tokyo street on a rainy day during rush hour, where one’s view can encompass ten thousand people, it can seem as if every single one of them has the same black umbrella. The Japanese also tend to be highly time organized, to tragic result in 2005 when the engineer of a Kyoto-bound train one minute behind schedule—a significant deficit in Japan—increased the train’s speed to at least eighty miles per hour on a section of track with a forty-five-mile-per-hour speed limit. The train jumped the tracks and plowed into an apartment building, killing seventy-three people and injuring more than four hundred others. The country’s rigid social hierarchies are reflected in its language, which allows for at least four different levels of politeness in manner of speech, adjustable for the genders, ages, and relative social, family, or business position of the speaker and listener. (The system can be cumbersome in the case of conflicting hierarchies, as, say, when a younger brother is the boss of an older brother at work, in which case the older brother would use deferential language with his brother at work but superior language elsewhere.) The written language relies on three separate systems of characters: one for the grammatical elements of a sentence, as well as for the names of some plants and animals and for anything that needs to be written phonetically; one for the hundreds of foreign words that have become a regular part of the Japanese language; and one for everything else. Japan also has a sort of caste system that leaves more than a million of its people essentially ineligible for better jobs, and in some cases better homes, simply by virtue of their ancestry.</p><p>But the Japanese can be messy in some ways by other countries’ standards. Tokyo and some one hundred square miles around it represent one of the great urban sprawls of the world, a vast, dense, largely undifferentiated mixture of residences, businesses, heavy industry, and even farms, some of which lap right up against the edges of Tokyo proper. Visitors to Tokyo often think they’re being teased when they’re told that most buildings have no address, in the sense of a street name and number, but it’s true; addresses refer only to a complex, irregular, and nearly useless system of districts and subdistricts. The only reliable way to find a building is to have someone familiar with it specify directions there by landmarks.</p><p class="h1">Weapon of Mess Destruction</p><p class="p1">The world can only assume that terrorists are eager to get their hands on a nuclear bomb, which if detonated in a city could flatten most of it, kill millions, and threaten an entire region of a nation with drifting radioactive fallout. True nuclear bombs require either plutonium or uranium. (<em>Dirty bombs,</em> which are several orders of magnitude less destructive, merely scatter around any sort of radioactive material.) Building a plutonium nuclear bomb is probably beyond terrorists’ means, but a crude nuclear bomb based on uranium probably isn’t. The bigger challenge to terrorists would be getting their hands on the needed fifty kilograms or so of “highly enriched” uranium—uranium that is extensively processed to have unnaturally high levels of unstable atoms. The bad news is that there are several plausible ways they could acquire the stuff. The good news is that the atomic instability that makes radioactive materials potential weapons also provides a critical tell: in any given second, some tiny fraction of the atomic nuclei in a chunk of enriched uranium spontaneously blows apart, hurling tiny bursts of energy called gamma rays into the environment. Enriched uranium, in other words, announces its presence, at least if someone’s listening nearby with the right equipment. And herein lies an opportunity for a mess-savvy government to foil a nuclear plot.</p><p>The United States uses several types of sensitive detectors to foil attempts to smuggle enriched uranium into the country. At border crossings, airports, and seaports, for example, detectors examine cargo for gamma rays and for lead and other heavy-metal shielding that suggests someone might have something to hide from a gamma-ray detector. Detectors are also placed around major roadways leading into some large cities, sometimes at toll plazas. The problem is that, knowing about the detectors, terrorists are likely to enlist an ingeniously messy and very simple countermeasure. They’ll hide a small, shielded sample of uranium in the middle of any of the thousands of densely cluttered cargo containers or trucks that can enter a seaport or border crossing or city during a busy hour, when agents and detectors tend to be overwhelmed checking out the many containers and vehicles that contain harmless items that can trip detectors. “Bananas, Fiestaware, beach sand, Coleman lanterns, smoke detectors, kitty litter, Kaopectate—these are all naturally radioactive,” notes Carl Czajkowski, director of a program to test new radiation detectors at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Or a terrorist with a chunk of uranium can simply avoid official border crossings, seaports, and major entrances to cities, and sneak in through unobserved routes.</p><p>That leaves the government with two possible strategies. First, it could attempt to impose more order on would-be uranium smugglers by spending hundreds of billions of dollars to better seal up America’s roughly twenty thousand miles of coastline and borders, and hundreds of billions more fencing off major cities, except for a few closely watched entrances, and then forcing each and every vehicle and container that passed through any of these points to undergo a thorough scanning—a process that would bring our borders, seaports, and transcity traffic, along with the economy, to an utter standstill.</p><p>A second strategy would be to match the messy behavior of smugglers by scattering detectors around more widely. Detectors are already available in the form of devices the size of cell phones, and these could be issued to all government workers and even to millions of civilians, and placed throughout public areas. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is working on a networked system of radiation detectors and cameras capable of identifying a vehicle carrying enriched uranium at highway speeds, and scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have come up with a flexible glass fiber detector that can be embedded in asphalt roadways. Installing these sorts of devices in large enough numbers nationwide might cost hundreds of billions of dollars right now, but a more random, smaller-scale deployment around cities could be affordable and offer a better chance than now exists to finger any rogue uranium. What’s more, unlike the cost of sealing up borders and cities, the costs of detectors are rapidly plunging. A bigger challenge would be dealing with all the false alarms from innocently radioactive materials, including the radioactive substances in the blood of about one in twenty-six hundred Americans at any particular time because of a medical procedure. But new generations of detectors are emerging that can better differentiate between uranium and, say, kitty litter.</p><p>Any scheme to significantly improve our chances of spotting enriched uranium is going to carry a staggering price tag and still leave us with large holes and inconveniences. Perhaps the most useful way to apply the concept of mess to the terrorism threat is to recognize that in terms of national security, at least, we have been enjoying an extraordinarily neat and ordered way of life in the United States, and like all highly ordered systems it is therefore highly vulnerable to disruption. Lawrence Wein, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who studies port security, says that Americans must on one hand be psychologically prepared not to exhaust their resources trying to stop what may be inevitable but highly confined attacks, such as a dirty bomb or a suicide bomber, and on the other hand get the government to do whatever it takes to try to head off the catastrophic ones, such as a nuclear bomb or an anthrax outbreak. It is indeed a grim form of mess triage, but if it helps stop an almost inconceivable disaster, there’s little to recommend against it.</p><p class="h1">Road Mess</p><p class="p1">A mile from the intersection of the Boston area’s celebrated Routes 128 and 9 is a narrow, two- and sometimes three-lane road with a wicked curve that runs past department stores, upscale specialty shops, and good old Strymish’s bookstore. This retail spread is sufficiently attractive to consumers throughout the area that traffic conditions along the cranky road range from sluggish to stop and go.</p><p>In the late 1990s, senior managers at the Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Companies reasoned that, since so many shoppers passed through that spot already, why not also throw in a really big supermarket? Predictably, the local community, based in the town of Newton, objected on the grounds that the addition of a giant supermarket would send area traffic over the top. No problem, responded Stop &amp; Shop; the company would happily subsidize the conversion of the road into something a little more comfortable for the hubbub it channeled. Instead of two or three cramped lanes, the area could be served by a wide, modern, four-lane road with entrance and exit ramps and carefully timed traffic signals.</p><p>The concept of replacing older roads that have become overrun with more traffic than they were designed to handle with new, larger, straighter, more carefully organized ones seems perfectly sensible and has been a staple of traffic engineering and urban planning going as far back as the road itself. You’d think that of all the things a municipal, county, state, or national government could do, improving roads would be a surefire winner. There’s just one small drawback to the approach: traffic frequently gets worse after a larger, more carefully planned road is put in.</p><p>The reason is simple. When a better, wider road is constructed between two points, it doesn’t just service the cars that were traveling between those points all along, it also attracts new drivers who are impressed with the traffic-handling capabilities of the better road. And not only does an improved road attract travelers, it also attracts residents who want to live nearer to good roads and businesses that want to be nearer to a passing stream of potential customers. Now, one might reasonably argue that this sort of development can be a good thing from some points of view, but it doesn’t alter the fact that traffic increases. The injection of this “induced traffic,” as traffic engineers call the increase, more often than not wipes out whatever improvements in traffic flow the new road offered, and then some. University of California researchers who studied roads in thirty urban counties discovered that for every 10 percent increase in the number of new lane-miles, traffic increased by 9 percent. Another study estimated that expanding roadways in the Greater Cincinnati area caused congestion to jump by up to 43 percent. In the case of Stop &amp; Shop’s planned improvements, estimates suggested the new road would see at least eight thousand additional cars per day, enough to nearly gridlock the area. Narrower, windy, busy roads unbothered by precisely spaced entrances and exits and by cleverly timed lights may be a bit of a mess, but they’ll get people where they’re going faster than wider, more organized replacements clogged with neat, highly regulated traffic jams.</p><p>The failure to account for induced traffic is only one reason traffic ordering schemes can go wrong. More generally, says Alan Horowitz, a traffic forecasting researcher at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee’s Center for Urban Transportation Studies, traffic planning is hard to get right because all kinds of things tend to go screwy in ways that planners couldn’t possibly anticipate, including shifts among political forces, lurches in the economy, and changes in where people want to live and work. “Thirty-five years ago I thought it was possible to play SimCity with traffic planning—you just plot land use and where people wanted to go, and you magically had a perfect transportation system,” Horowitz says. “I eventually learned you have to go with the flow. We’re constantly working in response mode to random and disorganized inputs.” The best way to plan roads, he adds, is to “build the seemingly disorganized patterns into our planning.” In other words, if people’s driving needs are messy, it’s not inappropriate for road systems to be somewhat messy.</p><p>In the case of Stop &amp; Shop’s proposed road project in Newton, the city’s board of aldermen wisely declined to provide the votes needed to approve it. But the company’s lawyers did their homework and came up with another neatness-based political gambit. It turned out that the board hadn’t complied with an obscure paperwork requirement when it filed its decision, leading a court to rule that the company could go ahead and build its store and “improve” the roads. It seemed as if all the stars of excess order were aligning, until a local superhero of mess came to the rescue. New England Mobile Book Fair’s Steve Gans coauthored a brief to help sway the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts to rule against Stop &amp; Shop, killing the project.</p><p>The building of wider, more carefully planned roads is not the only sort of traffic-neatening attempt that backfires. Many neighborhoods have discovered that speed bumps, intended to reduce accidents by forcing cars to make their way through in a slow, measured fashion, sometimes invite precisely the opposite sort of result. Some drivers are oblivious to the bumps until they are upon them, at which point they slam on their brakes, risking a loss of control or a collision with a closely following car. Other drivers discover that speed bumps actually provide less of a bump at high speeds than at moderate speeds, because the jolt to the wheels comes and goes so fast that the shock absorbers essentially don’t have time to transmit it to the frame of the car. A stream of skidding, colliding, and speeding traffic is hardly what the installers of speed bumps had in mind.</p><p>A fix to the speed-bump problem seemed at hand in the 1990s when engineers at a traffic laboratory in the United Kingdom endeavored to restore order through more careful design. The result was the <em>speed hump,</em> a spread-out version of the bump that transmits a bigger jolt at higher speeds and less of one at moderate speeds. Humps were an immediate hit in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada and have caught on to some extent in the United States. But in recent years, numerous experts have come forward in all of these countries to argue that speed humps are more likely to contribute to injury and death than to prevent them. The biggest problem is the slowing of emergency vehicles, especially those carrying cardiac patients, whose chances of surviving drop with every wasted second. In London, which installed more than twenty thousand speed humps, the humps have been cited as a factor in the city’s unusually poor survival rate for heart attack victims. Not only do humps slow fire trucks on their way to fires, but the jolt on a ponderous fire truck that can’t or won’t slow down is severe enough to have caused permanent spinal injury to firefighters. Buses designed with low floors to accommodate disabled passengers are especially vulnerable to damage and severe jostling, even at low speeds. The U.K. transportation lab that developed the hump now encourages communities to consider alternatives.</p><p>Not all projects intended to bring order to traffic make traffic worse. Most Boston-area residents who drive into the city or to its airport can attest to the fact that the “Big Dig” roadway project, largely completed in 2004, has shortened travel times, in some cases considerably. Many experts warn that the improvements, which included the construction of a new tunnel under Boston Harbor and a major highway underneath the city, will yield to renewed congestion in the coming years, but only time will tell. In the meantime, Bostonians can mull over the Big Dig’s cost of neatness: $14.6 billion, or twice the cost of the Panama Canal in constant dollars. Considering the Big Dig project was highly controversial at the originally approved price tag of $4 billion, it’s hard to imagine that there would have been much support for the project if anything approaching the true cost had been forecast.</p><p>But even if the delays return, the city will still have something to show for the billions. A major component of the project was tearing down an elevated major artery through the city and building in its place a New Urbanism–style pedestrian mall, accessible to outer-ring residents via several light rail lines.</p></div></body></html>
