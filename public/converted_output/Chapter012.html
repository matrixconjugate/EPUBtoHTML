<p class="epi">“When philosophers try to be politicians they generally cease to be philosophers.”</p>

<p class="normal">The American Philosophical Association (APA) has three divisions (Eastern, Central and Pacific) and more than 11,000 members, including many non-Americans. It is probably the most important philosophical organization in the world. It also has a long and rich history of being drawn into leftist political activism. A brief overview follows.</p>
<p class="subheading" id="asec36"><a href="Contents.xhtml#sec36">Philosophers Advise: Withdraw from Vietnam with the Maximum Physical Speed!</a></p>
<p class="normal">At the business meeting of the Eastern Division of the APA in 1969, Hilary Putnam proposed that the APA adopt a resolution against the war in Vietnam. The proposed resolution said, among other things, that the war was “a direct consequence of a foreign policy whose basic aim is to make and keep a large part of the world safe for American enterprise”; that the peace negotiations in Paris actually “serve the purpose of deceiving the American people”; that “the United States economic involvement in various parts of the world—particularly in underdeveloped countries—amounts <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_164" title="164"></span>to the exploitation of the peoples of these countries and is, therefore, not in their interest”; and that “the United States economic involvement in various parts of the world necessitates the suppression of popular rebellions by acts ranging from open warfare to undercover activities by the CIA.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">It is odd that despite the obvious controversiality of most of these statements, Putnam intended them to be adopted and publicized as the opinion of the whole APA. Nevertheless, the attempt to suspend Putnam’s proposal failed to get enough votes. A revised version of the resolution was finally accepted, with the following main conclusion: “[W]e oppose . . . the claim that the United States has any right to negotiate the future of the Vietnamese people, and we advocate instead the total withdrawal from Vietnam of all American forces as fast as is physically possible.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">It is unclear whether those who voted for the resolution were aware that one of the main points of those negotiations they so staunchly opposed was an attempt to prevent the expected invasion of South Vietnam by the Communists from the North as well as the massacres and massive crimes that were anticipated in the event of such an invasion. And indeed, when the eventual departure of the American troops allowed the Communists to take over, the worst fears came true: According to R. J. Rummel, an analyst of mass killings and other crimes by states, in the period between 1975 and 1987 there were at least 50,000 extrajudicial executions in Vietnam, more than a million Vietnamese people fled the country (most of them the “boat people”) and in the process more than 100,000 of them died at sea, while he estimated that around 2.5 million people went through re-education camps and possibly half a million were condemned to forced labor. (The APA never considered a motion to protest any of this, or call on anyone to do something about it.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the philosophers’ demand that U.S. forces withdraw with the greatest speed that is <i>physically</i> possible shows their astonishing disregard of the complexity of such a political decision on multiple levels. For instance, aren’t there obviously many <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_165" title="165"></span>military and political issues that would have to be considered and evaluated before a reasonable person would publicly defend this policy of lightning-speed withdrawal? And isn’t it very clear that participants at the business meeting of the Eastern Division of the APA were not in a position to assess these very complex and highly relevant issues?</p>
<p class="bodytext">A good point (and pertinent in our context) was made in a discussion about another case of faculty opposition to the Vietnam War in a letter to the <i>New York Times</i> on April 2, 1967. I will only slightly change its wording: “It is not clear why people trained in [philosophy] believe their opinions on military and international problems should carry much validity. Certainly they would oppose unqualified Pentagon generals telling them how to teach their courses.”</p>
<p class="bodytext-bs">One of the severest critics of the APA’s resolution against American involvement in Vietnam was Ayn Rand (1999, 48):</p>
<p class="blockquote">The outcome was a double disgrace: (1) that a philosophical association passed a political resolution and (2) the kind of resolution it passed.</p>
<p class="blockquotei">(1)<span class="spacec3"></span><span class="hide"> </span>No professional organization has the right to take an ideological stand in the name of its members. A man’s ideas, including political convictions, are exclusively his to determine and cannot be delegated to or prescribed by anyone else. . . . The practice of passing ideological resolutions is a futile and immoral device of pressure-group warfare. For all the very reasons that a philosopher, as a thinking individual, should take a strong stand on political issues, he should not allow it to be taken for him by a collective. . . .</p>
<p class="blockquotei">(2)<span class="spacec3"></span><span class="hide"> </span>If movie stars give out interviews criticizing <i>military</i> tactics, no one takes it seriously. If drugged adolescents scream demands that the war in Vietnam be ended at once, regardless of means, methods, context or consequences, one wonders about the quality of their educators. But when an association of philosophers does <i>both</i>, it is a disgrace.</p>
<p class="bodytext-ts"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_166" title="166"></span>Ouch! A huge number of philosophers regard Rand as a crude thinker who does not deserve to be called “philosopher” at all. Besides, since philosophers strongly lean to the political left, they tend to find her political views repugnant.<sup><a href="#krch12fn1" id="kch12fn1">1</a></sup> And yet, it is hard to deny that in this particular case Rand did hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It is not that criticisms of the politicization of the APA were not expressed within the association itself. They were, but with no effect, because apparently they did not coincide with “the general will” of the association. In 1971 a group of philosophers, spearheaded by Sidney Hook, Harry Frankfurt, and Nelson Goodman, raised their voice against the recent wave of political resolutions adopted by the APA. They wrote: “A philosopher or teacher of philosophy does not join the APA in order to use it as a vehicle for his political opinion. He does not give the APA, by joining it, a mandate to make political pronouncements in his name” (reported in the <i>New York Times</i>, May 30, 1971).</p>
<p class="bodytext">But their intervention had no effect: The flood of political resolutions continued.</p>
<p class="subheading" id="asec37"><a href="Contents.xhtml#sec37">The APA Decrees on Abortion, IQ, Nuclear Weapons, Death Penalty, Iraq War . . .</a></p>
<p class="normal">In December 1971, Hilary Putnam proposed that the APA “condemn as unscientific and dangerous the views of [Harvard psychologist Richard] Herrnstein, [Nobel laureate physicist William] Shockley, and [University of California, Berkeley, educational psychologist Arthur] Jensen concerning the genetic basis of differences in mean intelligence between blacks and whites.”<sup><a href="#krch12fn2" id="kch12fn2">2</a></sup> The proposal also condemned the <i>Atlantic Monthly, Harvard Educational Review</i>, and the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> on the strange ground <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_167" title="167"></span>that they “irresponsibly supported” these “unfounded conclusions” merely by publishing articles in which these claims were defended. Despite complaints that the views in question should not be condemned without sufficient evidence and that the condemnation actually opposed the exercise of free speech and free research, the motion carried and was put to mail ballot. It was voted down, but a similar motion was proposed again the following year. Although it was suggested that it made no sense to push the same motion that had been defeated the previous year, without any events’ occurring in the meantime that would likely change the result, the motion carried and was again put to mail ballot (with an unknown result).</p>
<p class="bodytext">In 1972 a resolution defending the pro-choice side in the abortion debate was proposed. David Lewis opposed it on the grounds that “no corporate body ever should vote on a moral issue, even on one so clear as this.” Contrary to what Lewis said, there was nothing clear about this issue, unless the clarity of moral issues is understood as being determined by the majority opinion among philosophers. This was all happening immediately before the Supreme Court’s decision on <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, and the nation was notoriously split on the issue. Lewis must have been well aware of this. It is possible he just wanted to signal that he also regarded the pro-choice position as clearly correct himself, but that he was still against the APA taking a side on such a divisive issue. Next it was announced that the Society for Women in Philosophy supported the resolution. After that, the majority voted in favor of the resolution.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Around that time, frustrated by the politicization of the APA, Robert Nozick proposed that some of its members be condemned “for manipulating the meeting for the sake of sectarian political interests of their own.” Tellingly, his motion was not even put to a vote because no one at the meeting was willing to second it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Later, a number of other political resolutions were adopted at the meetings of various divisions of the APA. Among other things it was concluded that “it is improper for Congress to decree by law that human life begins at conception”; that “the United States government should attempt at all cost [!?] to encourage political stability between the Soviet Union and the United States”; that the <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_168" title="168"></span>members of the APA are “to use their resources to educate their students and their communities about the negative effects the death penalty has on the social, political and spiritual well-being of the nation”; that “members of the American Philosophical Association express our serious doubts about the morality, legality and prudence of a war against Iraq led by the United States,” etc.</p>
<p class="bodytext-bs">Political activists managed to secure the majority of votes for resolutions on all these issues at the APA’s meetings. However, it should be mentioned that the politicization of the association was sporadically criticized by individual philosophers who made a number of very good points, mainly in letters to the editor in the APA bulletin:</p>
<p class="blockquote">What then could justify the APA in taking sides on the sort of broadly philosophical issues that tend to become bones of contention in the political arena? . . . Furthermore, by what principle was the death penalty chosen as the topic of an APA resolution rather than, say, partial-birth abortions? Should the APA endorse a package of positions, issuing pronunciamentos on the Balanced Budget Amendment, handgun control and ebonics? If not, why not? (William Vallicella)</p>
<p class="blockquotei">It is ludicrous to the point of self-parody for an APA division to give serious consideration to a resolution that tells division members what position to take (and to advocate to their students) on a philosophically controversial issue. (Felicia Ackerman)</p>
<p class="blockquotei">If I believed that any action of the APA could prevent nuclear war, I would of course support it. But the suggestion that such is the case does little credit to a profession whose announced aims include the advancement of rationality. (Philip E. Devine)</p>
<p class="blockquotei">The problem before us is whether a professional and scholarly association does not become unfaithful to its destiny, to its logic, by taking a stand on political questions. It would mean the beginning of complete politicization of our organization . . ., and this is the hallmark of totalitarianism. (Aron Gurwitsch)</p>
<p class="bodytext-ts"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_169" title="169"></span>But there was no indication that the APA’s leadership appreciated the force of these points or that it was willing to reconsider the association’s policy about its political interventions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some members pointed out that by getting involved in politics the APA was actually violating its own charter. They quoted Article 3.1 B of the APA Constitution, which reads: “The Association is established exclusively for educational and scientific purposes as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Michael Kelly, executive director of the APA, responded to this complaint by claiming that the APA’s bylaws “allow resolutions of this type to be put before its members for a mail vote, provided certain guidelines are followed.” In support of his claim, Kelly extensively quoted from the APA’s bylaws. Yes, Kelly is right that bylaws specify the rules for adopting resolutions, and he is also right that these rules were followed in the case of the resolution against the Iraq war. But obviously this was not the issue raised by the critics. Their point was simply that as the APA was established for <i>educational</i> and <i>scientific</i> purposes, the association’s engagement in <i>political</i> affairs was clearly out of order. Kelly had nothing to say in response to this.</p>
<p class="subheading" id="asec38"><a href="Contents.xhtml#sec38">How Yugoslav Marxists Pulled a Fast One on the APA (and Other Philosophers)</a></p>
<p class="normal-bs">At the meeting of the Eastern Division of the APA in December 1972, several “concerned members” proposed that the Association send a letter to Yugoslav president Tito in support of eight Marxist philosophers from Belgrade who were associated with the Yugoslav philosophical journal <i>Praxis</i> and who were at that time under political attacks. Here is the most important part of the letter:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Dear Mr. President, Marshal Tito:</p>
<p class="blockquote">We have been following with great interest the building and democratic development of an equitable and free society in Yugoslavia during the last two decades. We are, therefore, <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_170" title="170"></span>alarmed and depressed by repeated reports recently appearing both in the Yugoslav press and other journals. It is now reported that some Yugoslav publications are being suppressed, passports of Yugoslav citizens confiscated, and Yugoslav intellectuals put on trial for the expression of their views. We are especially concerned by the reports of decisions taken in local political organizations in your country to remove from their teaching positions eight professors—some of whom are internationally known. . .</p>
<p class="bodytext-ts">Robert Nozick moved that the first sentence of the letter be deleted because it “implied a positive evaluation of the degree of democracy in Yugoslavia,” but his motion was defeated by a very large majority.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The APA could hardly have chosen a worse moment to compliment Tito for promoting a “free society.” It was only several months earlier that hundreds of students in Croatia (then a part of Yugoslavia) were arrested for their completely nonviolent political activities. Among those condemned to long prison sentences were many writers, journalists, academics, and students. A strange scene indeed: What American philosophers hailed as a “free society” in the making massively incarcerated its own citizens when they demanded freedom!</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some defended the laudatory sentence in the APA’s letter, arguing that it was “not a political endorsement but a strategic appeal to the self-image of the Yugoslav powers-that-be.” If so, the strategy failed miserably. Tito must have been pleased with the flattery but predictably made no concessions. When intellectuals try to outmaneuver dictators they usually only manage to make fools of themselves.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Although the political oppression in Yugoslavia in 1972 was notoriously and heavily centered on Croatia, the APA sent a copy of its letter to the Presidium of the National Assembly of the Republic of <i>Serbia</i>, but not Croatia. So the APA was “especially concerned” about the fate of the eight philosophy professors in Belgrade who were not even removed from university at the time, while it was <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_171" title="171"></span>not concerned at all about many more people in Croatia (some of them philosophers and philosophy students) going to prison for years just for expressing their political opinion.<sup><a href="#krch12fn3" id="kch12fn3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="bodytext">APA members obviously relied on the <i>Praxis</i> philosophers for information about the situation in Yugoslavia, uncritically accepting the highly biased political narratives of their Yugoslav Marxist colleagues. The <i>Praxis</i> philosophers always presented themselves as staunch critics of any nationalism. Their professed cosmopolitanism appealed to their brethren in the West, but in reality it was only a façade behind which lurked a thinly hidden Serbian nationalism.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What gave the game away was when in 1972 <i>Praxis</i> published a protest against a court decision in which a Belgrade philosopher (a member of the advisory board of <i>Praxis</i>) was convicted of <i>Serbian</i> nationalism and received a two-year prison sentence (soon to be commuted to nine months). In contrast, the <i>Praxis</i> philosophers were all eerily silent when around the same time a philosopher and two philosophy students received longer prison terms for <i>Croatian</i> nationalism. So from the <i>Praxis</i> perspective one nationalism (Serbian) was to be protected as a matter of free expression, while the other nationalism (Croatian) was deservedly punished as a dangerous criminal act. The irresistible conclusion was that the <i>Praxis</i> philosophers were in fact Serbian nationalists in cosmopolitan clothing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This was soon further confirmed when the main witness for the prosecution in a 1972 Stalinist trial of two Croatian philosophy students joined the editorial board of <i>Praxis</i> only a few months after his appearance in court. This was widely perceived as a reward for his help in securing a conviction for the political opponents of the <i>Praxis</i> group. (The two philosophy students spent three and four years in prison, respectively.)</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_172" title="172"></span>It would have been extremely easy for American philosophers to learn about these or similar episodes and realize the extent of <i>Praxis</i>’s political bias and untrustworthiness. They only had to ask for “a second opinion” from someone in former Yugoslavia from the opposite side of the political spectrum, or at least someone who did not belong to the hard left. But they apparently did not. So being way out of their depth in this matter they were not only easily drawn into a web of deception but also managed to involve the APA in this shady affair. In the end, the same ill-advised letter was sent to Tito on behalf of a group of Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which included distinguished philosophers like Carl G. Hempel, John Rawls, Willard V. Quine, Wilfrid Sellars, Patrick Suppes, and Ernest Nagel.<sup><a href="#krch12fn4" id="kch12fn4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="bodytext">In another open letter to President Tito (<i>The New Humanist</i>, March 1975) signed by a number of British academic luminaries, including some eminent philosophers (like Bernard Williams, Alfred Ayer, and Peter Strawson), the issue was again made <i>only</i> of the case of the Belgrade <i>Praxis</i> philosophers and their teaching positions being in jeopardy, as if this had been the worst violation of academic freedom in communist Yugoslavia in the mid-1970s. Besides ignoring the plight of those professors in Croatia who were at that time not only fired but were serving sentences of up to seven years’ imprisonment, the letter writers expressed admiration for the Yugoslav system and said that “the inner organization of universities, with its self-managing, autonomous faculty councils, had seemed to be one of the most democratic in the world.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Is it possible that people like Williams, Ayer, and Strawson really believed in the “self-management” fairy tale? Did they not realize that the so-called “autonomy of the faculty” was a complete sham and that universities in Yugoslavia were tightly controlled by ideologues from the Communist Party? Furthermore, it is bewildering that Bernard Williams, once described by <i>The Times</i> as the “most <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_173" title="173"></span>brilliant and most important British moral philosopher of his time,” publicly praised the organization of universities in a one-party communist country as being among “the most democratic in the world,” while only several years later “he left Britain for Berkeley in protest at the impact of the Thatcher government’s policies on British universities” [Chappell 2013]. His message with respect to universities appeared to be: Communist tyrant (before the <i>Praxis</i> incident) good; elected conservative government intolerably bad.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A similar open letter to Tito in defense of the “Belgrade eight” was sent by another group of Western academics (mostly philosophers) and published in the <i>New York Review of Books</i> in 1975. What these academics—including Ayer, Chomsky, Føllesdal, Habermas, Hintikka, Ricoeur, and von Wright (Wittgenstein’s successor at Cambridge)—found “particularly shocking” was the newly introduced law for the Republic of Serbia authorizing the parliament to suspend university teachers from their positions. Again, how come they were so shocked about that new law in Serbia but none of them were shocked by the simultaneous persecution of Croatian academics that was much more severe and on a much larger scale? Again, a part of the explanation is that many of these Westerners were simply too naive and easily hoodwinked by their main sources of information, whose extreme bias and mendacity they never recognized.</p>
<p class="bodytext-bs">In 1978, three Princeton philosophers (Richard Rorty, Richard Jeffrey, and Robert C. Tucker) wrote a letter to the president of Princeton urging him to support the Inter-University Center (IUC) in Dubrovnik, Croatia:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Our principal motive in making this proposal is the need to support Yugoslavian scholars who are under pressure from their government, and for whom the IUC is a haven. In particular, the so-called ‘Belgrade Eight’—a group of philosophers and sociologists who have been discharged from their teaching positions because of their defense of academic freedom and human rights generally—are still able to use the IUC as a sanctuary (quoted in Gross 2008, 230).</p>
<p class="bodytext-ts"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_174" title="174"></span>So in the eyes of the Princeton philosophers <i>the main value</i> of the IUC consisted in its serving as a “haven” or “sanctuary” for the “Belgrade eight.” But when thirteen years later two most prominent representatives of the “Belgrade eight,” Mihailo Marković and Svetozar Stojanović, got top positions in the Serbian government around the time it ordered the shelling of Dubrovnik (during which the IUC building was destroyed), Rorty, Jeffrey, and Tucker had nothing to say publicly about that event nor about the complicity of some of their Belgrade protégés in the politics that led to that attack on their previous “sanctuary.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Two more letters in support of the <i>Praxis</i> group were published in the <i>New York Review of Books</i> in 1980 and 1984. A number of philosophers were among the signatories, including Sidney Morgenbesser, Thomas Kuhn, and Donald Davidson. Some, like Adolf Grünbaum and Richard Rorty, signed both letters. It turned out that out of fourteen people whose cases were mentioned as examples of repression in Yugoslavia, <i>all</i> were Serbs. Although the American philosophers must have known that Yugoslavia was a multiethnic country, they did not find anything odd in this total lack of ethnic diversity. Surely they could not have believed that only Serbs were victims of political repression.</p>
<p class="bodytext">One of these “victims” was Vojislav Šešelj, who only a few years later—not unpredictably—took part in persecution of non-Serbs during the war in Yugoslavia, for which he was later charged by the International Criminal Tribunal with crimes against humanity, murder, forced deportation, illegal imprisonment, torture, and property destruction.<sup><a href="#krch12fn5" id="kch12fn5">5</a></sup> It is also notable that Chomsky, Davidson, Grünbaum, and Rorty were appalled by “the unusually harsh penalty of eight years in prison” that Šešelj received in 1984, but they remained unfazed by an even “more unusual” case when, a few years earlier, a Croatian university professor was sentenced to eleven <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_175" title="175"></span>years of imprisonment because of an interview he gave to a foreign journalist.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Although all these philosophers probably believed that they were defending a noble cause of human rights in a troubled country, in reality they were sucked into a world they did not understand and manipulated into defending only one side in an ethnic conflict. Ironically it was the side that was soon going to bear by far the greatest responsibility for the bloody war and atrocities against civilians in Croatia and Bosnia.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Even later, on the brink of war in former Yugoslavia, when the Serbian nationalism of the leading members of the <i>Praxis</i> group was expressed much more freely on the international scene, some Western philosophers were still unable, or unwilling, to believe what their eyes were telling them. For instance, in 1990 (at the time it was publicized that Marković, the doyen of the <i>Praxis</i> group, became the vice president of Slobodan Milošević’s militantly nationalist and war-mongering party in Serbia), the journal <i>Praxis International</i> (the international successor of <i>Praxis</i>) published Marković’s paper about the Serbian-Albanian conflict in Kosovo in which he defended a preposterously biased view and blamed only the Albanian side.<sup><a href="#krch12fn6" id="kch12fn6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="bodytext">It was only two Hungarian editors (Agnes Heller and Ferenc Fehér) who were outraged and resigned in protest, saying, “We do not sit in the same board with a Serbian nationalist, it is against our principles” (Agnes Heller, personal communication). Heller later commented: “Americans did not understand, they believed that we were overreacting. They wanted to persuade us to return, but we answered that they had no idea about the context.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Heller was spot on: Americans did not understand nor did they have any idea about the context. It took them considerable time to realize the truth. The Yale philosopher Seyla Benhabib, a longtime fan of the <i>Praxis</i> group and one of the editors-in-chief of <i>Praxis International</i>, eventually wrote in 1995: “Many of us felt that <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_176" title="176"></span>the wool was being pulled over our eyes by our colleagues in former Yugoslavia in what they were or were not publishing in the pages of the journal about conditions in their own country” (Benhabib 1995, 675).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Indeed. At long last Western philosophers started coming to their senses. But too little, too late.</p>
<p class="subheading" id="asec39"><a href="Contents.xhtml#sec39">The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Politics of Citation</a></p>
<p class="normal">There are many other examples, besides the APA, of important philosophical institutions undertaking political actions that are not only unreasonable but also occasionally harmful to the profession. A good recent illustration is the jumpy reaction of the editors of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) to a reported gender disparity in philosophy and their hasty and ill-considered attempt to correct it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">To see how the mere numerical fact of gender disparity—unaccompanied by any understanding of its origins or awareness of potential consequences of meddling with the existing situation—can move prominent philosophers to rush to a conclusion and galvanize them into urgent action, consider the following sequence of events. On June 19, 2013, the sociologist Kieran Healy publishes data on his blog showing that of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors get only 3.6 percent of the total. Although Healy warns that “this is exploratory work” and that there are unanswered “questions about the underlying causes of any patterns that show up in the data” as well as “various comparisons that sound straightforward . . . but are actually quite complicated to answer properly, or imply a lot more data collection and analysis than I can do here,” when Edward Zalta and Uri Nodelman, the editors of the SEP, learn about Healy’s data they decide the issue needs immediate attention. On July 12 (just three weeks after Healy’s posting), they send an email with the subject “SEP request concerning citations” to all SEP authors, subject editors, and referees, which includes a link to Healy’s text, informing the <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_177" title="177"></span>SEP collaborators that the editors take the issue of undercitation of women philosophers seriously. Although they don’t explain why the issue is so pressing or what their objective is (besides pushing some numbers up), they announce that they want to “encourage our authors, subject editors, and referees to help ensure that SEP entries do not overlook the work of women or indeed of members of underrepresented groups more generally.” Furthermore, the collaborators are also urged to write to the editor “any time [they] notice a source missing from an SEP entry (whether or not it is [their] own entry).”</p>
<p class="bodytext">There are at least five problems here. First, Zalta and Nodelman seem to assume, without providing any evidence, that the “undercitation” of women is at least partly the result of philosophers’ bias, i.e., their tendency to “overlook” women’s publications more often than men’s. Second, the way the editors try to address the problem of the low citation of women looks very much like an attempt to cure a disease without knowing its cause. Third, their action will have a perverse effect as well. Namely, de facto pushing (or nudging) so many scholars to cite more female philosophers (and to report on those who fall behind in this task) may distort genuine citation patterns in the discipline and undermine the integrity of a bibliometric analysis of philosophical publications. Fourth, there might be another perverse effect: If the SEP initiative to boost the citation of women’s publications becomes more widely adopted in philosophy, then philosophers who do not believe that the “undercitation” is due to sexist bias might react to the new situation by correcting for what they perceive as the citation inflation for one group. As a consequence, they might start to take the number of citations of a woman’s work as being, on average, a less reliable sign of scholarly quality than the number of citations of a man’s work. And fifth, it should be expected that other demographic groups would soon follow suit and demand that their “unfairly” low citation rate be similarly jacked up.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Given the SEP’s importance to the discipline—in many ways it serves as a standard-bearer for philosophy as a research field—it is odd how unconcerned the editors were about making such crude <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_178" title="178"></span>and blatantly political considerations a part of their official editorial policy. Even odder is that of hundreds (thousands?) of philosophers who have been acquainted with the new citation guidelines for more than two years, no one has decided to start a public discussion about that issue.</p>
<p class="bodytext-bs">For another indication about how far the SEP editors have been willing to give in to the political pressure of the feminist lobby, look at <a href="#ch12tab1">Table 12.1</a>, which shows the number of articles in the encyclopedia that have the word <i>feminism</i> or <i>feminist</i> in the title, compared to the number of articles about some other, historically much more important, philosophical positions.</p>

<p class="bodytext-ts">The number of the SEP article titles that contain <i>feminism</i> or <i>feminist</i> is <i>more than four times higher</i> than the number of <i>all</i> articles <i>combined</i> whose titles mention the foundational philosophical isms of empiricism, materialism, idealism, rationalism, and naturalism. Given that feminism is a relatively new arrival to the philosophical scene and is still far from being a core area of philosophical research, there is simply no way the comparatively exorbitant attention it has received could be justified by invoking ordinary criteria of the profession.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This whole section draws heavily on the article “Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis” (Sesardić &amp; De Clercq 2014). We argue there that although many philosophers and philosophical associations claim that women are underrepresented in philosophy largely due to discrimination, the evidence for this accusation crumbles under examination. At <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_179" title="179"></span>the very least it seems safe to say that even those who support the discrimination hypothesis ought to concede that their case is not open-and-shut. But they do not.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Hume famously said, “A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.” It appears, however, that today most philosophers live by a less epistemically responsible dictum: “Believe in discrimination.”</p>

<p class="footnote" id="krch12fn1"><a href="#kch12fn1">1</a> Lawrence Summers, who knows a thing or two about American universities, said in a recent talk: “Philosophy departments almost without exception boycott Ayn Rand’s disciples.”</p>
<p class="footnote" id="krch12fn2"><a href="#kch12fn2">2</a> It appears that Putnam did not even read Herrnstein’s article carefully before asking the APA to condemn it, because at the time Herrnstein explicitly expressed agnosticism about the possible genetic basis of the racial gap in IQ (Herrnstein 1971, 57).</p>
<p class="footnote" id="krch12fn3"><a href="#kch12fn3">3</a> According to the section on Yugoslavia in the Amnesty International’s report for 1972, eleven Croatian intellectuals were sentenced to terms of imprisonment from one to six years, while about twenty Croatian students were sentenced to up to four years’ imprisonment. No other part of Yugoslavia is mentioned in the report. In later reports Amnesty International singled out 1972 as the year with an especially high number of trials for political offenses in Yugoslavia “when there were widespread arrests and convictions, <i>in particular in Croatia</i>” (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="footnote" id="krch12fn4"><a href="#kch12fn4">4</a> See “Yugoslav philosophers under fire,” <i>Index on Censorship</i>, 2, 1972, pp. 63–64. A note appended to the letter says that the letter was sent to the scholars on the list for their signatures, but one of them confirmed to me by email that all of them had signed it.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="krch12fn5"><a href="#kch12fn5">5</a> Speaking about war criminals, it is noteworthy that two principal members of the <i>Praxis</i> group (Mihailo Marković and Ljubomir Tadić) signed a petition in 1996 in which Radovan Karadžić, the infamous leader of Bosnian Serbs, was proclaimed to be innocent of any crime and was called “the true leader of all Serbs.” Eventually the Tribunal in the Hague convicted Karadžić of genocide, persecutions, extermination, murder, deportation, forcible transfer, terror, unlawful attacks on civilians, and hostage taking. He was sentenced to forty years’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="krch12fn6"><a href="#kch12fn6">6</a> Although around that time Amnesty International reported that “in recent years, the majority of people charged with political offences have been ethnic Albanians from Kosovo province,” Marković argued that “the Albanian nationality in Yugoslavia already <i>enjoys more rights and privileges than any other minority in the world</i>, therefore it is unreasonable and not acceptable to demand even more” (Marković 1990, 412; emphasis added).</p>
