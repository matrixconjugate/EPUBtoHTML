<p class="normal">Many colleagues and friends read earlier drafts and helped with useful comments. I owe special thanks to my former graduate student Nathan Cofnas who went through several versions of the manuscript and suggested many significant improvements. I also received valuable feedback from Tomislav Bracanović, Rafael De Clercq, Zvjezdana Dukić, Berislav Horvatić, Andrew Irvine, Tomislav Janović, Paisley Livingston, David Papineau, Sean Scully, Ante Sesardić, Peter Singer, David Stamos, Matej Sušnik, Omri Tal, and Daniel Wikler.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When I was finishing the first version of the book manuscript and when I started thinking about a potential publisher, I decided that my first choice would be Encounter Books. So I was thrilled when Roger Kimball offered me a book contract. I would also like to thank the production manager Katherine Wong for helping with many details and Dave Baker of Super Copy Editors.</p>
