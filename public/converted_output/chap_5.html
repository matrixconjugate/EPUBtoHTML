But other than a few terms like <em>slob</em> and <em>pack rat,</em> we don’t have much terminology to describe personal messiness. Let’s fix that. After all, if we’re going to accuse someone of being messy, we ought to be at least a little organized about it.</p><p class="h1">Types of Messy and Neat People</p><p class="p1"><em>The mess terrorist:</em> Inflicts dysfunctional mess on others to achieve advantage or personal satisfaction. Examples:</p><p class="bl1">• An employee who completes a task in a deeply disordered fashion to avoid being assigned that task in the future. A proactive variation is to demonstrate such a muddled understanding of a task’s instructions that the task is withdrawn.</p><p class="bl">• The nineteenth-century French farmworkers who tried to prevent the encroachment of mechanized harvesters and other new farm machinery on their livelihoods by jamming the equipment with their wooden clogs, or sabots—thus leaving us with the term <em>sabotage.</em></p><p class="bl">• The lawyer who responds to a subpoena for a client’s records by turning over hundreds of unlabeled crates of documents in no discernible order.</p><p class="bl">• <em>The order terrorist:</em> Inflicts dysfunctional order on others to achieve advantage or personal satisfaction. Examples:</p><p class="bl">• The health-insurance claims processor who rejects any claim that diverges in even the most trivial way from perfect compliance with complex, confusing paperwork rules.</p><p class="bl">• The police officer who tickets a motorist for not signaling a lane change on an empty road.</p><p class="bl">• The department manager who chastises subordinates for tackling tasks helpful to the company because the tasks are outside the department’s formal responsibilities.</p><p class="bl3">• The parent who always makes a child put away all toys before leaving her room.</p><p class="p1"><em>The entrenched messmaker:</em> Creates a mess impenetrable to others to maintain influence. Examples:</p><p class="bl1">• The administrative assistant who sets up a filing system or appointment book so idiosyncratic that no one else can find or schedule anything.</p><p class="bl3">• The consultant who wrote New York City’s impenetrable tangle of codes regulating the shadows that proposed buildings will cast on other buildings, necessitating his hiring to determine compliance.</p><p class="p1"><em>The order phony:</em> Creates an appearance of order while hiding a mess. Examples:</p><p class="bl1">• designer who maintains a sparsely decorated, neat-as-a-pin apartment used only for entertaining, while living in a messy apartment next door.</p><p class="bl">• The couple who remove all clutter from most of their rooms, throwing it into stupendous, disorganized heaps in a few rooms closed off for that purpose.</p><p class="bl">• The professional who fastidiously enters appointments in an electronic organizer but ignores what’s in it.</p><p class="bl3">• The suit-jacket-and-tied television news anchorman whose jeans and boots are hidden by the desk.</p><p class="p1"><em>The mess phony:</em> Creates an appearance of mess while hiding order. Examples:</p><p class="bl1">• The teenager who spends twenty minutes in the mirror fashioning a look of casual disarray.</p><p class="bl">• The senior manager who kills time so he can harriedly show up late to meetings.</p><p class="bl3">• The store manager who takes sorted goods off neat racks and piles them mixed together in bins to create a bargain feel.</p><p class="p1"><em>The mess pervert:</em> Derives pleasure from mess for its own sake. Examples:</p><p class="bl1">• The student who leaves her dorm room deeply littered with dirty clothes, spoiled food, and worse, in part because it feels more comfortable than a neat room.</p><p class="bl">• The manager who believes that the massive clutter in his office, which is disrupting the flow of work through the company, confirms how busy and important he is.</p><p class="bl3">• The boss who constantly and unapologetically forgets or ignores meetings at which she’s needed.</p><p class="p1"><em>The order pervert:</em> Derives pleasure from order for its own sake. Examples:</p><p class="bl1">• The handyman who replaces each tool in its bin the moment he stops using it, even if he may need it again any moment.</p><p class="bl">• The parent who insists on serving dinner at precisely the same time each night, regardless of the fluctuations in everyone’s schedules.</p><p class="bl3">• The manager who demands that requests for vacation be submitted three months ahead of time.</p><p class="p1"><em>The orderly procrastinator:</em> Avoids real accomplishment by endlessly reneatening and reordering. Examples:</p><p class="bl1">• The professor who spends entire days reorganizing her computer files.</p><p class="bl">• The homemaker who maintains a large alphabetized collection of spices that is restraightened and replenished with each spice usage.</p><p class="bl">• The middle manager who keeps massaging his task list without actually achieving any of the tasks on it.</p><p class="bl3">• The mother who spends more time gathering and sorting toys than playing with her children.</p><p class="p1"><em>The mess savant:</em> Finds surprising ways of extracting new functionality from messes. Examples:</p><p class="bl1">• The researcher who matches graduate students to projects by letting them scan through the mess on his desk to see what catches their interest.</p><p class="bl">• The manager who schedules conflicting meetings that sometimes result in overlapping attendees usefully swapping ideas and teaming up.</p><p class="bl3">• The chef who leaves an array of random ingredients splayed out around her, leading to her trying out novel combinations.</p><p class="p1"><em>The order prig:</em> Takes satisfaction from demonstrating a higher level of order than yours. Examples:</p><p class="bl1">• The neighbor who, unsolicited, offers the name of his landscapers.</p><p class="bl">• The colleague at a meeting who, when the boss starts discussing deadlines, pulls out his electronic organizer with a flourish and starts loudly tapping away.</p><p class="bl3">• Martha Stewart (though perhaps a bit less so, postincarceration).</p><p class="p1"><em>The order hero:</em> Misattributes positive but largely random outcomes to his order schemes. Examples:</p><p class="bl1">• The mayor who claims a local drop in crime is due to her anticrime programs, even though it mirrors a national fluctuation.</p><p class="bl">• The hedge-fund manager who touts the fund’s good results over the past few months, when markets have been rising.</p><p class="bl">• The CEO who attributes a modest rise in recent sales to his new long-term strategy.</p><p class="bl3">• The racehorse trainer who credits a new workout regimen and race strategy for the big win.</p><p class="p1"><em>The mess distractor:</em> Misattributes the failure of her order schemes to the messiness of external events. Examples:</p><p class="bl1">• The mayor who claims a two-year rise in the local crime rate exceeding the national average is due to a dip in the national economy.</p><p class="bl">• The hedge-fund manager who insists the fund’s collapse was rooted in a change in tax laws, rather than to his disastrous investments based on misreadings of long-term markets.</p><p class="bl">• The CEO who attributes a drop in yearly sales to adverse weather.</p><p class="bl3">• The racehorse trainer who blames sloppy track conditions for three consecutive losses.</p><p class="p1"><em>The order bigot:</em> Declares her scheme of order is better than yours. Examples:</p><p class="bl1">• The Apple Macintosh user who insists Windows is harder to use.</p><p class="bl">• The high school teacher who makes students buy a particular dictionary.</p><p class="bl3">• The management consultant who recommends removing or adding a layer of management to improve corporate performance.</p><p class="p1"><em>The mess-iah:</em> Offers to sell you the secrets to achieving order utopia. Example:</p><p class="bl1">• Anyone who proposes to help you get organized, establish highly effective habits, do more in less time without worry, declutter, simplify your life, continually improve your processes, reorganize your organization, or plan for success.</p><p class="h1">Ways People Can Be Messy</p><p class="p1"><strong>Collectively Messy</strong> Sometimes a set of individual messes ends up being pooled to cause a large-scale mess, as with, for example, car pollution or murmuring in a courtroom or a cluttered family room. More subtly, a collective mess can emerge even when there are no discernible individual messes, as when, for example, a company’s information about its clients is dispersed among individual employees. Each employee may very neatly track information about several clients, but the company may still have no good way of getting an overview of its entire client list or even of figuring out which employees have the needed information on a particular client.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Appropriately Messy</strong> It’s hard to argue that nuclear power plants, tax records, and parking lots shouldn’t be well organized. But there are also many elements of our lives that, although often kept neat and highly ordered, are probably better off left at least a little messy, as for example vacations, friendship, art, naps, memories, pets, divorce, sports, desserts, dating, playing, getting fired, reading, sex, combat, raising children, and death.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Cosmetically Neat Messy</strong> Some people simply don’t care how messy and disorganized they seem to others. But those who do care can take just a little time to look neat and organized, even if they really aren’t. An infrequent bather with well-combed hair can look neater than an ultrahygienic colleague with unkempt hair. Likewise, heaps of paper can be gathered into piles and stuffed in a drawer unsorted; clothes can be heaved into closets; meetings can be scheduled to take place in your own office so you don’t have to remember to be on time for them; a car overdue for a safety inspection and an oil change can be run through a car wash; and an employee can adopt a precise-sounding title like “assistant manager of internal customer relations,” even though she does whatever she feels like doing on a given day.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Weak-Link Messy</strong> People can go through great trouble to set up a carefully organized system, only to have the system crumble into utter dysfunction because the order is highly dependent on a single element that’s vulnerable to disruption. Some examples: the dropped electronic organizer, the shopping list left at home, the administrative assistant out with the flu, the emergency-response command center with no working phone connection.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Sloppily versus Structurally Messy</strong> When you’re sloppily messy, you don’t stick to an established scheme of order. When you’re structurally messy, you don’t <em>have</em> an established scheme of order or you have a poor one. Some sloppy messes: strewing clothes around the bedroom, showing up late to a 9:00 a.m. meeting, allowing your car to wander into another car’s lane. Some structural messes: leaving CDs in piles on the floor because you don’t have bins or shelves for them; not being able to find everyone you need for an impromptu meeting; colliding with another car in an unlaned parking lot.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Transiently Messy</strong> Even people who are normally well organized can wisely recognize that there are times when organizing needs to take a backseat to higher-priority tasks for a while, allowing mess to reign for a limited time. Thus, there is the office that becomes densely cluttered during the two weeks it takes to finish the big report; the football team that skips the huddle as the clock is running out; the supply sergeant who relaxes the tight controls on ammunition when his unit is facing a sudden enemy offensive.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Provocatively Messy</strong> Sometimes people generate or tolerate mess out of curiosity, playfulness, or experimentation. That’s the case with a professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who sometimes left perishable food out for as long as years to observe its evolution; a school administrator who lets students plaster certain walls, sidewalks, and monuments with graffiti; and a manager at a button-downed firm who occasionally shows up at the office in island-casual dress.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Contextually Messy</strong> In some situations we expect people to be messy, and in others we expect neatness. We wouldn’t blink, for example, at a cluttered artist’s studio, but might be appalled to see the same degree of clutter in the office of a large-company CEO—as if discipline has no place in art, nor creativity in business. Some people manage to bend these unwritten rules of contextual mess, though, as for example the artist who generates his works via mathematical equations, or the charmingly eccentric average-Joe CEO who looks comfortable in an apron slinging hash alongside employees on the front line.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Constitutionally Messy</strong> Inspired by large companies and government agencies that want a more ordered way to assess job candidates, experts have come up with personality tests that, among other things, endeavor to judge how organized or disorganized a test taker is by nature. The venerable Myers-Briggs test, for example, rates people as either “judgers” who are “planned” and “orderly,” or “perceivers,” who are “flexible” and “spontaneous.” There’s good reason to be skeptical, though. Aside from the question of whether orderly people can be encouraged to loosen up, there’s the fact that the test itself isn’t as neat an evaluation as some would like to believe. People who take the test twice have a better than 50 percent chance of ending up with a different assessment the second time.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Existentially Messy</strong> Some people seem bound to weave mess into the very course of their lives. These might include those who jump from job to job, move from town to town, or try on spouses and significant others in a serial fashion. Career criminals probably fill the bill, too. And most of us know people who always seems to stumble from one minor crisis to another, with never an end in sight. They may simply be remarkably unlucky, or it may also be that some people thrive on instability.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Genetically Messy</strong> In the last U.S. census, more than seven million people listed themselves as multiracial. What’s more, compared to the general population, a disproportionate number of them—some 40 percent—were under age eighteen, suggesting that there’s an upward trend. Aside from the fitness-for-survival advantages to genetic mixing well established in the plant and animal kingdoms, the blurring of human genetic lines might go a long way toward easing the societal tensions and conflicts that often go hand in hand with divisions in race and culture. Progress along these lines will no doubt be slower in many other countries, some of which have much neater ideas about appropriate lineage. In Iraq, for example, about half of all marriages are between first or second cousins.</p><p class="h1">Some Common Mess Strategies</p><p class="p1">Many people say they never have time to get organized, when, in fact, they constantly engage in useful organization strategies that keep things sufficiently under control. Here are some of the effective mess-management techniques that people frequently enlist without appreciating their efficiency and effectiveness:</p><p class="spb"><strong>The Mini-mess</strong> Tolerating a constrained, clearly delineated pocket of mess within a larger area can make it much easier to maintain a higher level of order in the area. Some people set aside one section of kitchen counter, one bedroom closet, a few shelves in a den, or a desk in an office as a sort of mess sink, which removes the pressure of straightening out an entire room. In the same way, messy bulletin boards and refrigerator surfaces can keep the rest of a kitchen free of mail, children’s drawings, and other paper mess.</p><p class="spb"><strong>The Full Moon</strong> Mess can have natural cycles in which it builds up for a while before being at least partially organized at predictable periods. It may be a matter of tolerating disorder for most of the week until free time comes up on the weekend, or of putting up with it through the school year and paring it back over the summer, or of ignoring it and then massaging it in sync with the ebb and flow of work pressures, parenting duties, and even mood.</p><p class="spb"><strong>The Tower of Power</strong> Almost anything looks pretty neat if it’s in a pile. You don’t necessarily have to get the items in the pile in any particular order or even keep like things together. Gravity can be an amazingly effective glue: the magazines, CDs, books, photographs, playing cards, receipts, and bag of pistachios spread across a coffee table can all be made to pose in a neat, stable, not terribly obtrusive stack. The neatness level can always be kicked up a notch by adding a bin where a pile forms—a way of building around mess instead of fighting mess.</p><p class="spb"><strong>The Archaeologist</strong> A large heap of items crammed helter-skelter into a drawer, filing cabinet, closet, or attic, or under a bed or desk, or even behind a couch, needn’t be dysfunctional, as long as the more important items tend to remain accessible at the top or outermost layer. That tends to happen naturally, as the oft-retrieved items don’t sit around long enough to get buried deeply, while the rarely needed items become entombed in levels that can be fun to excavate years later. Mess can also be secreted away in spots not normally considered storage areas, including behind or under furniture, or behind or between washing machines and dryers and other heavy appliances.</p><p class="spb"><strong>The Maintenance Plan</strong> Some people confronted with the piles and heaps and scatterings that have formed over time treat them like nuclear waste—something that requires a massive, costly cleanup and until then must not be trifled with. But others, more reasonably, are quick to make small adjustments to the mess to keep it under control and functional, such as scanning through a pile to make sure nothing important has been buried; getting rid of a layer or two of deeply buried, useless heaped mess to make room for a new layer; or corraling enough of the excess clutter in one part of a room to reclaim a usable area.</p><p class="spb"><strong>The Code Blue</strong> A potential mess crisis can be safely navigated via a brief, intense burst of organizing activity focused on the most critical elements. Word of an unexpected and imminent visitor might trigger a frenzy of highly efficient straightening out that transports the loose clothes from the floor and into the closet, sends a week’s worth of scattered newspapers into a bin, and gets the dishes into the sink, leaving a home perfectly presentable even after weeks of relative neglect. It works for offices, too.</p><p class="spb"><strong>The Satellite Mess</strong> There are 1.5 billion square feet worth of self-storage units available to rent in the United States. The money saved by not hiring a professional organizer could pay for years’ worth of storage.</p><p class="h1">Mess Mismatches</p><p class="p1">Nearly everyone has a story about dealing with a significant other’s mess-related quirks or vice versa. (The same can be true of business partners.) Mess in itself never seems to be a problem; it’s the difference in how the two people view the state of order in their home that rankles. The tensions aren’t always associated with a highly ordered person paired with a highly messy person; even small differences in overall mess tolerance, or merely in tolerance for different types of messes, can and apparently often do lead to stress and resentment. From the survey conducted for this book and from interviews:</p><p class="vtx1">“I am so intent on getting rid of piles that my husband leaves about that I once threw out a very large check. We were living in an apartment building and had to go through a very large outside Dumpster with many garbage bags to find our trash and then to locate the trash bag with the check.”</p><p class="vtx">“I once overheard [a colleague] on the phone scolding his wife for assembling his sandwich with the items in the wrong order.”</p><p class="vtx">“I asked my wife to get rid of the piles, figuring she’d just throw it all out, but when I got home I found she had spent the entire day going through just half a pile.”</p><p class="nl">“He is so methodical and meticulous when he finally cleans a room, it could be used as an operating theater! Meanwhile, the rest of the house looks like a bomb exploded.”</p><p class="vtx">“I used to yell at her for leaving crumbs after she made toast, but now I’m the one who makes toast and she yells at me for leaving crumbs.”</p><p class="vtx">“I rearrange the dishes after he loads the dishwasher.”</p><p class="vtx">“My husband can’t stand it when the bed isn’t made, but I can’t stand it when the dishes aren’t done right away.”</p><p class="vtx3">“I have to constantly straighten up, because if I don’t my husband trips over the clutter and gets injured.”</p><p>How large a toll does mess stress take on relationships? The conventional divorce and relationship literature tends to bury mess and disorder within the broader category of “arguments over household chores” or the like. But in our survey, nearly 80 percent of respondents who are currently living with someone said that differences over mess and disorganization were a source of tension, and one out of twelve named mess tension as a factor in a divorce, separation, or breakup. The survey also turned up some interesting differences in how men and women who live together perceive their own and each other’s messiness and disorganization. In a nutshell, men see themselves and the women they live with as being about equally neat and organized, while women tend to see themselves as being somewhat neater and more organized than the men they live with. Women, interestingly, give harsher marks to both themselves and their partners than men do.</p><p>Mess can impact the balance of power in a relationship. If one person maintains a home or office in the sort of messy state in which she knows where everything is, the other is at her mercy when it comes to finding things. A mess-friendly person paired with someone who guards a low tolerance for mess is in an excellent position to effortlessly wreak havoc on the other’s peace of mind. (People who readily and injuriously trip over clutter might be particularly wise to stay on the good side of their partners.) Nor are mess haters always easy to appease. One husband surprised his germaphobic wife with a thorough bathroom cleaning that included bringing a shine to the toiletry-littered top of the toilet tank. The wife was horrified to see the clean surface—she instantly and correctly calculated that getting at it must have required putting the toiletries into temporary but sickening contact with the contaminant-ridden bathroom floor.</p><p class="p3">Compromise is clearly the way to go for pairs of people inclined to work out mess-related issues. That can simply involve a mess-friendly person taking a little care to be neater, and a mess-hostile person taking a deep breath when a bit of clutter pops up. But here are two other strategies that can come into play:</p><p class="bl1">• <em>Complementary mess</em> takes the general form of “I’ll struggle to keep one sort of mess under control, and you struggle to keep a different sort of mess under control” and is most applicable when each person tends to be especially sensitive to a different form of mess. Some typical examples: one person can’t stand having dust or any sort of grime around the home, and the other can’t tolerate clutter; one hates having a messy kitchen, the other a messy bedroom; one person hates messy desks, the other disorganized files; one needs to have the house straightened out before leaving in the morning, the other before going to bed at night. Usually implicit in this compromise is a willingness to tolerate, to some extent, the other person’s insensitivity to your own neatness needs. Thus, the grime-sensitive person accepts that the other person will obliviously, not disrespectfully, track footprints onto clean floors.</p><p class="bl3">• <em>The mess demilitarized zone</em> defines boundaries between areas that will be subject to the mess preferences of one person, areas subject to the preferences of the other, and areas over which neither holds mess-related sway. It’s most useful when one or both people need to have some space where they brook no compromise to their preferences. Thus, one person might be free to be gloriously messy in the den, the other zero-tolerance-ordered in the living room, while both grit their teeth a bit in the kitchen.</p><p>Finally, a few words on fighting over mess with children. We’ve already noted that parent-child mess arguments have on occasion led to violent death—and who knows how many times such clashes have merely led to injury, let alone emotional trauma? In a poll of parents with children ages six to twelve, just under 90 percent of the parents reported that “the condition of their children’s rooms was a source of ‘mess distress,’” and 34 percent said that their kids’ “slovenly habits” were a “frequent source of arguments between parents and offspring.” Some suggestions from get-organized gurus: set a timer every night to let your children know how long they have to spend straightening up their rooms; confiscate toys left on the floor at bedtime, and make your child do chores to earn them back; force children who won’t spend time cleaning up to spend time in the “penalty box” instead. Just remember, when teenagers go off to college, many end up reveling in spectacularly messy dorm rooms during what may be one of the most productive periods of their lives.</p><p class="h1">The Seven Highly Overrated<br/> Habits of Time Management</p><p>1. <em>Being focused.</em> By zeroing in on specific goals and maintaining consistent habits designed to achieve them, time management orthodoxy tells us, we will avoid the distractions and less useful encounters that delay our progress. A few questions present themselves. What happens if after years of focus and consistency, you discover you’ve picked the wrong goals? Why have a growing number of high-competence institutions, like the University of Chicago and the U.S. military’s special operations forces, placed such a strong emphasis on cross-training and cross-functional interactions? How do you know that the things you are excluding from your life as time wasters are really time wasters if you’re excluding them from your life? And why do so many interesting and successful people have backgrounds that are brimming with inconsistency, false starts, and career twists?</p><p>One such person is Ben Fletcher, an Oxford-trained experimental psychologist who went on to become a business-school dean, and who now heads the School of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom. Fletcher has more recently founded a business consultancy called FIT that specializes in helping companies reduce workplace stress. The most common cause of stress at organizations, Fletcher explains, is mistreatment at the hands of managers, who often tend to be overly assertive, rigid, and intolerant. In working with managers to help them improve their behavior, he found that while managers could usually understand and accept the fact that they had been acting inappropriately, they were rarely able to make and maintain long-term changes in their behavior with subordinates. People are simply too conditioned to acting the same way every day, he says, which often means being locked into harmful habits. Focus and consistency, in other words, become barriers to solving problems. So Fletcher asked the managers to alter other, easier-to-change behaviors in their lives, like the route they took to work or what they ate for lunch or where they sat at meetings—anything at all, as long as it introduced some variation in behavior. The results were surprising: over the course of as little as a few weeks, managers who threw monkey wrenches into their routines in this way found that they were also able to change the way they treated subordinates. The reason, says Fletcher, is that people tend to get trapped in what he calls “habit webs.” When they try to effect an important, useful change, they find they’re stuck tight. But if they snip away at individual, thin, supporting strands of the web, the web can eventually be loosened enough to permit more important change. “New behaviors lead to new experiences, and eventually that helps people change the way they think,” he says. Fletcher has gone on to show that randomly varying easy-to-change habits not only helps people become better managers but also helps them lose weight and repair relationships with spouses and children.</p><p>2. <em>Packing more in.</em> The unstated assumption when people enlist all sorts of strategies intended to help them get more done in a day is that getting more done in a day is necessarily a good thing. Yet, some of the most ineffective people are masters at flinging themselves from task to task in a take-no-prisoners fashion, leaving each person they encounter feeling strangely untouched. On the other hand, those of us who are perpetually looking back at the end of the day, wondering how we got so little done, usually find that the important things are still getting accomplished and the people who are important to us are getting our full attention for as long as they need it.</p><p>3. <em>Keeping a list.</em> All get-organized experts treat list keeping as a fundamental tenet of their religions, but the fans of personal productivity guru David Allen are especially fanatical about it. According to Allen and his legions of supporters, getting tasks and obligations down on paper—or on computer, since Allen also touts task management software—will immediately ease anxiety and increase concentration. What’s a little hard to understand is how someone who can be so strikingly uplifted by the creation of a to-do list never came to think of starting one before Allen suggested it. In any case, it’s hard to argue that writing task lists is a bad thing. The problems arise with the faith people put in their lists. Even putting aside the possibility that you’ll lose or leave behind the list, if you’re only going to worry about accomplishing what’s on the list or, more realistically, the items that happen to be at the top of the list, then tasks left off or allowed to slip down the list simply aren’t going to get done. How do you make sure the right things are always on the list and in the right sequence? That would depend on which productivity guru you want to pledge your allegiance to. Allen wants you to arrange items on the list according to convenience—that is, tasks that you can accomplish together should be listed together. Stephen “Highly Effective Habits” Covey, on the other hand, emphasizes placing the items that are most important to your goals at the top of the list. Thus, you can choose between writing the report that’s critical to your job and neglecting to get the front porch light replaced, or remembering to buy duct tape when you pick up the new front porch light and neglecting to get the car registration renewed.</p><p>Allen’s and Covey’s vaguely New Agey books are hugely popular, but what if the satisfaction people claim to get from adhering to their techniques isn’t a function of the joy of getting more done but, rather, is a testament to these gurus’ skill in convincing people that following their advice will make them better people? It’s the one skill that all successful personal productivity and get-organized gurus appear to have in spades. Interestingly, both Allen’s and Covey’s more recent books suggest that the real point of all the lists and files and habits is to enable you to take time to contemplate the meaning of life and your unique place in the universe. Perhaps you really do need to follow a rigid set of one-size-fits-all time-management rules, such as those pertaining to keeping to-do lists, to get at what’s special about you. Or maybe even productivity gurus eventually come to wonder about their own place in the universe.</p><p>4. <em>Sticking to a schedule.</em> A strict schedule is a great idea, assuming you can precisely anticipate every turn of events that will take place over the course of the schedule and correctly guess what you and those who influence you will think and feel about everything that goes on moment to moment. Otherwise, building in some flexibility may be a good idea. Tight schedules are brittle: if one item on the schedule is thrown off, the entire remainder of the schedule may be out of whack. Assuming that deciding what you do over the course of a day or week is important, you will want to take your time and think very carefully about how you set up a schedule from which you don’t intend to deviate. Some people, in fact, will need to exert more effort setting up a schedule than they could possibly make up by having a carefully crafted schedule. A simple example would be spending 1.5 hours on Travelocity finding the most convenient flights possible for a trip and in the end saving an hour in travel time over the very first flights you looked at. Things can really get out of hand when you try to combine packing as much into your day as possible with rigid scheduling. This may work to some extent for dentists and hairstylists, but others may want to take a step back and reassess some basic assumptions about their lives—for example, those people who spend hours carefully mapping out a visit to Disney World on a minute-by-minute basis so as to maximize the number of attractions they can visit.</p><p>5. <em>Making kids get with the program.</em> There are parents who find themselves constantly fighting with their young children over routine tasks like getting dressed, washing up, and sitting down to breakfast. But some child therapists suggest that the underlying problem often is not the child’s intransigence but, rather, the parents’ inflexibility over the order in which tasks are performed. Many children, it turns out, like to have the sequence mixed up from day to day so that it seems less like a burdensome ritual. Adults might also benefit from mixing up the order in which they do things, but somewhere along the way most of us were trained to strive for consistency and routine and now feel obligated to pass on that bias to the next generation. One way to indoctrinate children into the culture of time management is to purchase the Time Tracker from Learning Resources, a $34.95 device that combines an electronic timer with bright red, yellow, and green lights intended to visually condition a child to adhere to a strict schedule. Thousands have been sold, according to the company. (Presumably, adding some sort of mild-electric-shock-delivering feature to the device would be crossing the line, at least in some U.S. states.)</p><p>6. <em>Longer-term planning.</em> We’ve discussed what comes of businesses taking the trouble to map out their intended actions and strategies over the coming years. Why shouldn’t that work about as well for individuals? In fact, it probably does. With the U.S. divorce rate hovering around 50 percent, and the career-changing bible <em>What Color Is Your Parachute?</em> now well into its fourth decade of bestseller-hood, it’s not hard to conclude that people are often kidding themselves when they think they’re capable of making decisions that will seem wise five years from now.</p><p>7. <em>Getting it done now.</em> Procrastination isn’t always a bad thing. For starters, it can keep you from working on tasks that ultimately turn out to be less important than you thought. Or as Calvin Coolidge put it: “If you see ten troubles coming down the road, you can be sure that nine will run into the ditch before they reach you.” (Not that Coolidge was much good at identifying the tenth trouble. Or at anything else.) The U.S. Marines have a saying, too: Plan early, plan twice. By which they mean, put off planning for an event as long as possible, because if you do it well ahead of time circumstances will probably change and require replanning. In fact, putting off undertaking almost any form of neatening or organizing will likely have some advantage, because it’s much more efficient to organize a large set of things at one shot than it is to try to organize them in pieces as they come along. If you want to organize your e-mail into categories, for example, you’ll do a much better job of it when you have a few hundred messages to consider rather than trying to set up categories based on a few dozen messages.</p><p class="spb">Stanford University philosophy professor John Perry has noted that habitual procrastinators who follow conventional advice and try to focus in on a few important tasks will usually find the approach self-defeating, since the very nature of procrastination involves putting off the important tasks at the top of the list. Better, he says, to take advantage of the fact that procrastinators put off work by throwing themselves into less important tasks and find a way to thrive on accomplishing those less important tasks—at which point you might well discover you’re in great shape after all. On his Web site, Perry writes this of his own procrastination:</p><p class="ext1">Take for example the item right at the top of my list right now. This is finishing an essay for a volume in the philosophy of language. It was supposed to be done eleven months ago. I have accomplished an enormous number of important things as a way of not working on it. A couple of months ago, bothered by guilt, I wrote a letter to the editor saying how sorry I was to be so late and expressing my good intentions to get to work. Writing the letter was, of course, a way of not working on the article. It turned out that I really wasn’t much further behind schedule than anyone else. And how important is this article anyway? Not so important that at some point something that seems more important won’t come along. Then I’ll get to work on it.</p></div></body></html>
