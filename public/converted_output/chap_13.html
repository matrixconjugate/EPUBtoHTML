Yet so intense was this performer’s dedication to jumping beyond the music as written that otherwise adoring audiences and backup musicians sometimes became annoyed at the length and off-the-wall intricacy of his extemporaneous musical wanderings, and he lost gigs over it. Even when sitting in with other musicians, he couldn’t resist changing their compositions on the fly.</p><p>The irrepressible improviser was Johann Sebastian Bach. If you’re wondering how Bach managed to reconcile improvisation with the highly ordered, intricate, precise domain of baroque music, consider that in the eighteenth century improvisation was regarded as an integral component of serious music. It would have been a second-rate performer indeed who thought to limit recitals to prescribed notes. The opportunity—the imperative, really—for improvisation was explicitly written into baroque compositions and in more than one way. Bach and other composers of the time rarely spelled out parts for cello, bassoon, harpsichord, and organ note-for-note, instead providing the players of these and other low-range instruments suggested chords on which they were expected to riff. Concertos contained cadenzas that challenged the soloist to cut loose from the confines of the sheet music, and the resulting long, furious improvisations were often the highlights of performances. Even when notes were specified on the sheet, musicians routinely threw in improvised flourishes, like chefs sprinkling an extra dash of this and sprig of that, and the ability to spontaneously insert such ornamentation was considered a basic element of musicianship.</p><p>Bach was thus hardly a renegade in his time for being fond of improvisation, but he was infamous for the extent and boldness of it. He would embellish at length on the organ, even in the middle of church services, apparently sometimes dismaying the officiators, choirs, congregations, and others who were simply trying to get through the liturgy. In other performances, he would take musical themes tossed at him from the audience and immediately improvise around them, much in the style of a contemporary nightclub comedian. Bach also enjoyed the then-popular practice of challenging other composers to musical duels of improvisation, as he did with the renowned French organist and composer Louis Marchand. So prodigious was Bach’s improvisational bent that today experts believe we only have a portion of his compositional oeuvre, much of it having been whipped up in performance and left untranscribed.</p><p>Bach and his colleagues could not have predicted that by the middle of the twentieth century the improvisational elements of their compositions, and of all classical music, would have been gradually and thoroughly excised. Composers had later filled in the bass lines and cadenzas with note-for-note versions, so that today musicians play only what’s on the page, and every performance is melodically identical to every other. Taking it on oneself to add off-the-cuff flourishes to the music in the middle of a performance would be seen not as an exhibition of musicianship and creativity, but as a career-ending stunt that violated the music—even though to do so would be far more in keeping with the composer’s intentions than the frozen-in-place versions we hear today. It has been a centuries-long organizing project that almost certainly would have appalled some of the very composers we most ardently lionize.</p><p class="spb">Throughout this book we’ve seen some of the ways in which mess and disorder, in their various forms, can be a great deal less harmful than they are usually made out to be. We’ve even seen how useful, and even necessary, they can be in many situations. Now, in this final chapter, let’s add one more claim: mess and disorder can be beautiful.</p><p class="h1">The Art of Mess</p><p class="p1">The presumed aesthetic failings of mess and disorder are prime—and sometimes the sole—motivators for straightening up and organizing. That is, much of what is objectionable to people about certain types of mess is simply that the mess seems ugly. But it’s often easy enough and perfectly sensible to add a cosmetically acceptable veneer to a mess—throwing clutter into a closet; stacking papers in piles; resurfacing narrow, winding roads instead of building new ones; hiding a convoluted order-entry process behind a stylish retail Web site; housing a fractious local government in a handsome town hall. The U.S. Marines are peerless warriors in large part for their freewheeling, independent, and improvisational style of operation, but the public gets the more comforting image of an immaculately squared away, ultradisciplined, strictly hierarchical corps.</p><p class="p3">In the realm of the arts, though, mess isn’t always best tucked away behind an ordered facade. Instead, mess can be an integral element of the creative vision; sometimes the disorder of a work of art is its most affecting element. As a conspicuous example, consider James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses,</em> widely held to be one of the greatest works of literature in the English language. <em>Ulysses</em> is a mess in almost every way that a book can be a mess, short of having the pages fall out when you pick it up. The plot is nearly impenetrably convoluted, the language dense and obscure. A fairly typical example:</p><p class="ext1">You were going to do wonders, what? Missionary to Europe after fiery Columbanus. Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt from their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: <em>Euge! Euge!</em> Pretending to speak broken English as you dragged your valise, porter threepence, across the slimy pier at Newhaven. <em>Comment?</em> Rich booty you brought back: <em>Le Tutu,</em> five tattered number of <em>Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge,</em> a blue French telegram, curiosity to show:</p><p class="exts">—Mother dying come home father.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine <em>Ulysses</em> inspiring the sort of reverence that it has if its story had been laid out in neater, clearer fashion, something more along the lines of the CliffsNotes version. Today it’s more the rule than the exception for the narrative of novels to jump around in time and space and between different points of view, to lay out a character’s confused thoughts in a form that is itself confusing, and to generally sprinkle in a measure of randomness and convolution. The disorder in a work of literature can even have the paradoxical effect of clarifying. Neal Stephenson maintains that his 2004 book <em>The Confusion</em> is in fact an intertwining of two separate novels. The author (or a character standing in for him) explains up front in a note to the reader that he has “interleaved sections of one with sections of the other so that the two stories move forward in synchrony,” in the hopes that “being thus confused shall render them the less confusing to the Reader.”</p><p>Filmmakers, too, sometimes inject a measure of mess into their works with satisfying results. In films such as <em>M*A*S*H, Nashville, Short Cuts, Gosford Park,</em> and the more recent <em>A Prairie Home Companion,</em> the director Robert Altman doesn’t so much weave a story as heap it on the viewer in pieces that often have a disjointed, spontaneous, rambling feel. Some of the films directed by the provocative director Gus Van Sant, most notably <em>Elephant</em> and <em>Last Days,</em> leave the notion of a conventional narrative thread almost entirely behind, instead presenting snatches of images, events, and dialogue that gradually acquire force in sum. Woody Allen is famous for relying on improvisation in his filming and is said to restrict his actors’ access to scripts to ensure it. Even Steven Spielberg, whose films tend to hew to more conventional exposition, managed to slip a substantial helping of mess into one of his megahits. <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> lurches and bounces its way through multiple, confusing plot lines built around frenetic scenes in which parallel lines of dialogue often clash, and where the important action sometimes takes place in the background, pushing the viewer to experience some of the main character’s bewilderment and anxiety.</p><p>Mess in classical music gets its due elsewhere in this chapter, but it’s worth mentioning that popular music has evidenced its share of disorder as well, ranging from the distortion, or “fuzz,” lovingly added by generations of rock musicians to their guitars—in 1975 Lou Reed put out a double album consisting entirely of guitar feedback—to the street and other background noises mixed into recordings by everyone from the Beatles to Nelly Furtado. (Some might also be quick to point out that more-contemporary classical compositions, with their frequent dissonances and staggered rhythms, are also showcases for explicit disorder and noise in music. But actually, the structure and flow of these pieces tend to be highly calculated, sometimes emerging from mathematical progressions, even if the underlying order isn’t always obvious. A good example would be the more challenging works of the early-twentieth-century Austrian-American composer Arnold Schoenberg, whose unconventional melodic constructions were carefully wrought, though they at first struck some audiences as so distressingly and unmusically noiselike that performances were occasionally marred by angry shouting and even brawls.)</p><p>The interdependence of art and mess is even stronger, or at least more explicit, in painting and sculpture. In Japan, this is to some extent old hat; the tradition of <em>wabi sabi,</em> or the beauty of imperfection, is said to date back at least five hundred years. The West was a bit slower to catch on. When the visual arts blossomed in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a widely embraced guiding principle was to hold up order, in its various forms, as an ideal. In balanced, standardized, uncluttered composition, in the heroic stances or graceful curves of subjects, and in virtuous and biblical themes, artists often strived to reveal order as a form of beauty and vice versa. There were certainly exceptions, especially among Dutch painters such as Vermeer and Rembrandt, who by the mid-seventeenth century were already experimenting with crowded, random-looking placements of figures and objects. But it was during the Romantic movement of the early nineteenth century that artists began to pick in earnest at the ordered conventions of painting, by literally blurring images, employing thicker and even lurid brushstrokes, and dropping the Sunday-schoolish lessons in codes of behavior. There is little of the neat and orderly in Delacroix’s dreamlike depictions of lions tearing into horses.</p><p>Impressionism widened art’s rift from the orderly, often taking the stuff of everyday peasant life and visually refracting it into bursts of color. Van Gogh took this messy process so far that even today many experts tend to regard his genius as the flip side of his mental disintegration. But madness wasn’t a prerequisite for pushing art into the realm of the disordered. While romanticism and impressionism were assaults on the orderly, expressionism and cubism, which followed in the beginning of the twentieth century, demolished it. After centuries of trying to nudge reality in the direction of perfection, the task of the artist had become in part to mess reality up.</p><p>Indeed, one of the greatest challenges to contemporary artists has been to come up with novel, provocative ways of being messy. Dadaism got this endeavor off to a rollicking start around 1915 by self-consciously breaking away from the established order of art in all ways—even by pointedly refusing to be a clearly definable movement of art. That is, to the extent that it was about anything, Dadaism was a disorganized embracing of disorder. That’s not easy to top, mess-wise. But many have tried. The formless blotches of abstract expressionism, the bizarre pairing of images employed by surrealists like René Magritte and Salvador Dal몠the riotous dribblings of Jasper Johns, the scrap collages of Robert Rauschenberg—all are at least in part attempts to employ some form of disorder, be it clutter, mixture, blur, noise, or convolution, among others. Today there are hundreds of established painters and sculptors who prominently incorporate elements of mess and disorder into their works. Among the messaphilic artists who have been the subject of major shows in recent years: Richard Tuttle, who wrangles bits of wire, plywood, rope, and other found objects into small, abstract works; Jon Kessler, who assembles video monitors, moving contraptions, and blotchy paintings into sprawling kinetic sculptures; Chris Jordan, who photographs industrial refuse such as sawdust piles, bales of recycled metal, and discarded cell phones; and Elizabeth Murray, who paints on a jumble of screwed-together minicanvases.</p><p>The German philosopher Martin Heidegger suggested that art resists categorization. That’s certainly right, but if one were forced to try, a category of “messy” would probably be at least as handy as any other.</p><p class="h1">Messy Tastes</p><p>In 1990, at age seventeen, Edward Zaki moved to Montreal from his native Egypt. By the time he was twenty-three, he owned two convenience stores. Returning to Alexandria, Egypt, in 1996, he reflected on the fact that he didn’t miss the stores so much as the food counters he operated in them, so he decided to open a restaurant. But what kind? He was torn between his exposure to the informal cuisine of North America, the classic French dishes worshipped in Montreal, the more ascetic influences of his childhood roots, and the coastal influences of Alexandria. Choosing not to choose, Zaki opened a Danny Meyer–like chain comprising an American bistro, a classic French restaurant, an alcohol-free restaurant, and a seafood restaurant. All were successful, but Zaki wasn’t done bouncing. He still had a brother in Montreal, and in late 2000 moved back. Higher costs there precluded immediately opening more than one restaurant, so he was again faced with choosing a theme. Or was he?</p><p>Walking into Zaki’s restaurant today is almost as disorienting as entering Harvey’s Hardware or Strymish’s emporia. It’s nestled in the heart of Montreal’s student-dominated Latin Quarter on Rue St. Denis, lined with restaurants that are uniformly informal, each focused on one of an array of ethnic cuisines. Zaki’s eatery, on the other hand, is clearly more upscale than its neighbors—this isn’t a souvlaki or bagel joint—but figuring out what sort of food it might serve, and even whether it’s a club or a bistro or a café or a gourmet restaurant, is a challenge. There is blue lighting in the front, and red toward the back; some of the lights have flowers inside them. White tablecloths are in force in the center, but a bit to the side people are dining at long, bare, counterlike affairs that are internally illuminated as if intended for browsing X-rays. What’s more, some of the diners are sitting not in chairs, but in playground swings hung from the ceiling. Toward the back, the tables are unadorned metal. A staircase by the entrance provides a glimpse upstairs of butcher-block tables glowing by firelight. The mystery only deepens with the long menu. Grilled octopus tentacles, foie gras, snapper encased in burned whole wheat, cheese-stuffed grapes in ham, raw vegetables, flaming cheese—no cuisine, approach, or even sensibility suggests itself. What’s more, the dishes are served in the Spanish style of tapas, small portions normally intended for snacking, though here they’re intended to be jointly amassed by a party of diners as full meals. It’s in this disordered themelessness, of course, that Zaki found his theme. And he provides fair warning in the name of the restaurant: Confusion.</p><p>Zaki explains with amiable intensity that his restaurant and menu both reflect and resolve his inner convolution. “I don’t have a sense of belonging to a certain place,” he says. “Instead of an inspiration, I had multiple inspirations.” Certainly, he had noted the popularity of “fusion” cuisine, dishes based on a careful, calculated blend of two styles, usually Asian and Western, as with Danny Meyer’s Tabla. But Zaki was looking for something more disordered, even unsettling. “I wanted to provoke,” he says. “I didn’t want someone to say, ‘Oh yeah, I had this in Paris once.’ I wanted to serve food that customers would either love because it’s different or hate because it’s different. What I didn’t want to hear was someone saying, ‘That was very good.’” Though an odd juxtaposition of dishes on the menu might set customers to scratching their heads, he wanted the clash to reach their palates—hence the tapas servings, ensuring that diners would combine them. In addition, the small portions make ordering more of a shared group experience, with all the sticky issues that might entail. “If you’re just ordering duck for yourself, you don’t have to have a discussion about it with your friends,” he says. “But if two or three people are sharing six or seven dishes, then they’re choosing together and talking about it.” Even the choice of the Latin Quarter’s mismatched ambience was part of the effort to thwart diners’ expectations.</p><p>The notion of mixing disparate decors and pushing customers to combine multiple cuisines into a meal is a bit off the wall. But when you think about it, given the hundreds of thousands of restaurants in North America, the oddest thing about the idea is that it hasn’t been tried more often. Perhaps with good reason, or so it seemed when Confusion opened. Even adventurous Montreal diners were initially nonplussed at Confusion’s fare, and dining parties debated long and hard among themselves and with their waiters over how to cobble together an appropriate meal before finally ordering. Zaki had been hoping for a certain amount of dialogue, but the debates were proving interminable enough to hurt the business—as was the fact that when the orders were finally put in, they tended to be on the skimpy side, simply because customers, wary of mix-and-match dining, were erring on the conservative side by trying fewer things. Zaki reluctantly put in a quick fix, in the form of a series of suggested seven-dish meals. Diners jumped at them, apparently finding them a satisfying compromise between the utter disorder of an undifferentiated, long list of strange, small dishes, and the ordinary, highly ordered experience of ordering a single dish. This way, they got some mess, but not a paralyzing dose of it. Not only do customers who order the preset meals tend to end up with more dishes, but they’re more likely to gravitate toward some of the more intimidating dishes. For example, few people ordered the foie gras at US$18 for a small serving, which had first led Zaki to consider taking it off the menu. But the preset meals that include foie gras have proved the most popular, and as a result, he is adding more versions of foie gras to the menu and is even considering making it a minispecialty of the restaurant.</p><p>Zaki concedes that there are certain inefficiencies that go along with a messy menu. Higher-end restaurants typically rotate a new dish onto a menu of perhaps six entrées every week or so, but at Confusion trying to rotate one-sixth of the forty or so nondessert dishes every week would be exhausting. Instead, he aims to rotate a little over half the menu once every three months, in part based on what people seem to be gravitating to and in part just to shake things up. One planned change, for example, is to introduce several kosher-style dishes, which no one has been asking for.</p><p>Zaki intends to build an empire of disordered eateries. Needless to say, it will not be accomplished by cloning Confusion. Instead, he has embraced vertigo, or more precisely <em>“Vertige”;</em> French for “giddiness,” this is the name of the new Montreal restaurant he opened at the end of 2005. Vertige takes a different approach to pulling diners out of their comfort zone and confounding their expectations. It appears at first glance to be a purveyor of classic French haute cuisine, and is located smack in the middle of a small beltway of mostly conventional chic eateries, but in this way Vertige is subversive. The menu at first suggests the French standards, but a closer look reveals some pointed oddities. In fact, every item on the menu features some sort of play on order. One multicourse meal, for example, is prepared as per classical tradition, but the courses are served in reverse order. In another, the sweet ingredients are swapped for salty ones and vice versa. The restaurant made an immediate impact, at least to read the Montreal newspaper <em>Le Devoir,</em> which pronounced barely a month after Vertige’s opening that it “already belongs on the list of Montreal’s finer restaurants.”</p><p>Riding high on this momentum, Zaki is considering a third restaurant. After all, he hasn’t yet begun to experiment with noise, clutter, and time sprawl.</p><p class="h1">Name That Tuning</p><p class="p1">Nick Keelan, a professor at the Lawrence University Conservatory of Music, describes a trombone part in the fourth movement of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony that tends to make professional trombonists sweat. It’s not that the part is jammed with technically challenging runs of notes; it isn’t. True, the part is “exposed”—that is, it stands out prominently against a relatively muted background—but that’s not it either. Nor is it the fact that the part demands a clear, round, majestic blast of sound, with sure and crisp transitions between notes. These are all routine demands for pros. The challenge, says Keelan, is to come in on tune.</p><p>Those of us who aren’t musicians, or at least trained in music theory, might think playing on key is the simplest, most basic demand on a musician—that sour notes, whether sharp or flat, are the sort of thing that good musicians leave behind in junior high school. What excuse could there be for playing out of tune? After all, orchestral musicians conspicuously take pains to tune their instruments in the noisy preperformance ritual initiated by a clear, workmanlike note from the oboe—a hard-to-tune instrument saved by tradition from having to adjust. And that should be that for tuning.</p><p>Or perhaps you know enough to realize it’s not quite that simple. Temperature is a factor, for example, in that instruments tend to heat up over the course of a performance, which changes their tuning. The change depends on the surrounding temperature, how much and how loudly the instrument has been playing, and whether the instrument is in sunshine or close to stage lights, among other factors. Correcting for it in the case of the trombone can involve adjusting the instrument’s tuning slide, changing how far out the main slide is pulled, or even just altering the precise position of the musician’s lips. Temperature can indeed be a factor in the case of the Beethoven part, because it’s the first time the trombonists play in the symphony. After having sat through the first three and a half movements without getting to hear what their instruments sound like, the musicians must guess at how their own instruments’ temperatures have changed. But experienced musicians learn how to estimate temperature-related tuning changes with surprising accuracy, and thus correcting for it isn’t the main source of tuning worries for trombonists playing the Fifth Symphony.</p><p>The real problem is inherent to tuning itself. Tuning to the oboe, far from settling the question, is really just a tentative beginning to what turns out to be a wild ride in tuning that can twist and turn from note to note and from instrument to instrument. At the heart of the matter is the fact that there’s really no absolute, universal meaning to “being in tune”—it’s a variable, inconsistent, dynamic judgment. In this sense, even the most disciplined, orderly performance of a familiar piece by a superb ensemble is really built on a slippery platform. And it’s exactly this sort of inescapable messiness that helps imbue performances with the sort of variation and unpredictability that can leave audiences mesmerized one day and bored the next.</p><p>To start to appreciate the vagaries of tuning, consider the piano. Until the eighteenth century, keyboard instruments were tuned like other instruments, which is to say via “just tuning.” Very simply put, just tuning involves tuning the keys so that when a scale is played one note at a time, the scale will sound pleasing as it climbs up the keyboard. That’s an intuitive scheme, and it’s how most people assume keyboard instruments are tuned today. But they aren’t, because it turns out there’s a thorny problem with just tuning relating to chords, or combinations of notes played simultaneously. Owing to an odd glitch in the relationships between the different sorts of notes that seem perfect to our ears, chords that sound lovely when played on one part of the keyboard of a just-tuned instrument can produce wobbling and other clashy effects when played on another part. The disharmony creeps in because the progression of notes in a just-tuned scale is somewhat irregular—a jump from one note to the note that is one full tone higher, as for example from a “do” to a “re” in the “do re mi” progression, typically ends up being slightly larger or smaller than a one-tone jump between two notes located elsewhere on the scale, such as “re” to “mi.” As a result, when the same scale is played in a different key—that is, when the scale starts on a different note—it can sound a tiny bit different. These small differences don’t much affect the integrity of the scales, but they end up hobbling some chords as they are moved from key to key. Through the seventeenth century, composers simply avoided these troubled chords. That works fine, as long as the piece isn’t transposed into a different key—that is, shifted up or down wholesale to a higher or lower pitch, as is often done when, for example, a piece is to be played with instruments other than the ones it was initially written for or even when a composer wishes to move a musical theme to a different key within a single piece.</p><p>By the eighteenth century, a number of composers, most notably the keyboard-centric Bach, had come to find the restrictions imposed by just tuning on chords and transposition burdensome and started to embrace another approach to tuning keyboard instruments. In this alternate technique, called <em>tempered tuning,</em> a keyboard instrument is essentially purposely mistuned. To oversimplify a bit, the tuner smooths out the variations in note-to-note jumps by rendering some notes very slightly flat and others very slightly sharp as compared to just tuning. The result is that scales no longer sound quite right when played note by note—that the notes are slightly off can be audible even to a musical layman with a moderately keen sense of pitch. But because the note-to-note jumps are more consistent than they are with just tuning, a chord that sounds good in one key will sound pretty good in any other key.</p><p>Bach advocated strongly for this useful mistuning, and publicly embraced one form of it, called “well-tempered tuning,” via one of his best-known compositions, “The Well-Tempered Clavier,” written specifically to demonstrate how the quality of a composition played on a tempered-tuned harpsichord is reasonably, if not perfectly, well preserved as it is transposed through different keys. (The <em>key</em> of a musical composition specifies the seven notes that make up the main scale around which the composition, or part of the composition, is based.)</p><p>Just tuning and various versions of tempered tuning competed for keyboard musicians’ allegiance throughout the first half of the eighteenth century. To make things worse, there was no widespread agreement on <em>concert pitch</em>—that is, on the pitch of A above middle C, the note to which the process of tuning is calibrated. As a result, the tuning of keyboard instruments and to some extent of entire orchestras varied in Europe from town to town, and might vary in one town from week to week. In fact, today’s international standard for concert pitch wasn’t accepted until 1939—and some well-known orchestras, including the Berlin Philharmonic, still insist on tuning to a different pitch. A slightly tweaked version of well-tempered tuning called <em>even-tempered tuning,</em> in which all the jumps between notes are made perfectly consistent, finally became more or less standard for keyboard instruments in the 1850s, and today keyboard instruments are tuned by this technique. (Bear in mind, therefore, that when you hear a performance of music written before the second half of the eighteenth century, you’re probably not hearing exactly what the composer intended, unless the musicians have taken the trouble to ensure they are adhering to the tuning scheme in effect in the composer’s day and town.)</p><p>Unlike pianos and other keyboard instruments, virtually all the standard instruments in an orchestra enlist just tuning to get those pleasing progressions of single notes. But the problem of aberrant harmonies between multiple notes played simultaneously doesn’t go away; with many instruments playing many different notes, there’s plenty of opportunity for the notes to clash. A piano player doesn’t have to worry about it, simply because she is stuck with whatever the piano tuner has wrought. But a trombonist or trumpet player or violinist has no such excuse—he has to shoulder a share of the responsibility for avoiding interpreting notes in a way that unpleasantly combines with those of other instruments and has to do it <em>by adjusting tuning on the fly</em> throughout the performance. How big an alteration is called for depends on the instrument (all instruments produce unique overtones that affect harmonies), the note, the key in which the note is being played, and the specific qualities of sound that the musician and conductor hope to achieve. The required adjustments aren’t always the sort of small touches that only a perfectionist conductor would appreciate. Nick Keelan points out that it’s not at all uncommon for an orchestra musician to have to alter a single, extended note by nearly a quarter tone—that is, half the distance from a C-sharp to a D—right in the middle of the note, because of other instruments coming in. Were the musician to simply hold the note as written, without retuning on the fly, it might be enough to evoke a wince from a sizable percentage of the audience. And almost everyone in the orchestra is constantly making these adjustments and readjustments in response to the music and to each other.</p><p>And so back to the trombonists’ challenge in Beethoven’s Fifth. Over the course of the more than half an hour of music that flies by before the trombonists’ conspicuous entrance, there is no way for a musician without perfect pitch—an ability nine out of ten students at the Juilliard School of Music do not possess—to know exactly where all the other instruments have gotten to in their own tuning, and even if there were, there’s really no precise specification of what unique tuning adjustment would be perfectly suited to it. There are so many variables that, in the end, the trombonists have to make their own technical and aesthetic judgments as to what tonal shade of the written note to play. And while this instance is a particularly challenging one, the same basic task faces every musician in an orchestra in a smaller way throughout every piece, note to note, and often even in the middle of an individual note. That even the pros can occasionally be more inspired than usual in this endeavor is all part of the magic of a performance.</p><p>In fact, the only time when tuning is a neat, straightforward task is before the start of the performance, when the oboe sounds that ethereal note, and the musicians commence their individual tuning rituals. Here, during that sudden cacophony of clashing scales, is the one occasion where there’s no ambiguity or variation in the meaning of notes. Then the orchestra becomes quiet, the conductor taps his baton, and the real mess begins.</p><p class="h1">Last and Misguidedly Least: Smell</p><p class="p1">Hans Rindisbacher, the Pomona College German studies professor who, in chapter 9, offered observations on German attitudes toward disordered behavior, has an interesting and fairly unique academic sideline. He studies smelliness. It’s a surprisingly rich field, encompassing brain science, culture, industry, and history, among other areas, and it’s one that is largely neglected. And that’s exactly what most fascinates Rindisbacher about the topic; our attitudes about odor make it, literally, the most unspeakable of messes.</p><p>Part of the cause of our inattention to smell may simply be that we don’t have much of an idiom of smell. The lack of an odor-related vocabulary impairs our ability to think meaningfully about smells, says Rindisbacher, and even to be fully aware of them. “Odor isn’t well grounded in language,” he notes. “You can’t describe a smell the way you can say something you see is square, blue, or angled. You have to rely on borrowed terms, and that’s where you run into trouble.” What he means is that aside from a few primitive, vague terms such as <em>smelly,</em> or <em>awful,</em> or <em>sweet,</em> we tend to categorize smells in terms of a relatively small number of odorously familiar entities: fish, flowers, wet fur, new cars, feces, vanilla, and so forth. Our reliance on doing so prevents us from being able to describe a novel smell on its own terms and leads us to overlook an odor’s subtleties and complexities.</p><p>How did we come to lack a richer language of odor? It’s because somewhere along the line, says Rindisbacher, we <em>wanted</em> to stop talking about smell. Odors rarely come up in conversation because bringing up the smelly is often regarded as impolite, crude, and discomforting. The disconnect is especially striking in literature, he contends, where writers who take great pains to precisely and creatively transmit the visual appearance of scenes, people, and objects routinely fail to offer more than a cursory suggestion, if any at all, of how they smell. Those authors who do make a point of occasionally bringing smells front and center, including Marcel Proust, Vladimir Nabokov, and Charles Dickens, stand out as exceptions for having done so. That may be because writers, if unconsciously, regard smell as a risky business. “You can’t control what an olfactory description will invoke in readers,” says Rindisbacher. “You have to refer to the odor of other objects to do it, and you don’t know what associations go with it.” Both reflecting and compounding the problem is that Western society—and especially the United States—has largely eradicated its smells. “Even supermarkets, with acres of food, are utterly unodorous,” he points out. The result is an average background smell level so low that anything that <em>does</em> smell strikes us as unusual, and more often than not unpleasantly invasive. In other words, smell for most of us has become a sort of cartoon sense, providing exaggerated feedback on a tiny portion of the world around us.</p><p>That’s strange, really, because smell may be the most exquisitely discriminating of our senses. With their noses, dogs can detect cancerous tumors in humans; squirrels can recognize each other by the smells emanating from any one of five different glands. Studies suggest that we humans actually smell far more than we’re consciously aware of. Though our senses of smell are hundreds of times less sensitive than those of dogs, who can smell a few molecules’ worth of a substance, we’re capable of distinguishing some ten thousand distinct odors, sometimes in surprisingly small quantities. For example, we can pick out mere billionths of an ounce of E-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid, a key component of human body odor. And while we may marvel at the ability of mice to pick out their kin by smell, the fact is we might be able to do much the same. Infants can distinguish parents from strangers by smell, and in experiments many people turn out even to be perfectly capable of not only distinguishing other people by smell but also mice. If we didn’t go through so much trouble stripping ourselves of our smells and trying to dodge what smells remain, we might well open up whole new lines of communication.</p><p>Smell provides the only direct link between our brains and the environment. We smell something only when we’ve inhaled a piece of it into our nostrils, where it comes into physical contact with the tips of long, strandlike brain cells. The detection signals race from our nose along the brain cell to the olfactory bulb at the base of our brain. From there the signals move to the limbic system, the part of the brain responsible for moods, sexual urges, and fear, and then travel to the hippocampus, which controls memories. The signals then spread to the neocortex, which is thought to give rise to consciousness. Thus, smells have a unique pipeline to our emotions, recollections, and thoughts. As Nabokov put it, “Nothing revives the past so completely as a smell that was once associated with it.” Dickens made Scrooge “conscious of a thousand odors floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long forgotten.”</p><p>Truly appreciating smell may require losing it, as have approximately two million Americans. Anosmia, as the condition is called, can result from a gene defect, aging, viral infections, allergies, and prescription drugs, or from a head trauma, when a jarring of the brain shears off the delicate brain cells that snake to the nose through a bony plate in the skull. Without smell, people lose their primary defense from fires, gases, and spoiled food, as well as most of their ability to taste food. Specific anosmia, the inability to smell particular odors, is less devastating—which is fortunate, since studies suggest more than half of all people suffer from it. For that reason, any two people are likely to register different odors in many situations, making smell the only sense that gives us a window on the world that relatively few others share.</p><p>Rindisbacher contends our shunning of most things smelly got its start two centuries ago, with the general trend toward neatness and organization. “Now we think of smelly places as backward and inferior,” he says. Not surprisingly, few people advocate for the return of smelliness. And so we remain mostly oblivious to smell in everyday life, which means we don’t care to talk about it, which means we don’t acquire a language for it, which means we lose our ability to talk about it, which makes smell all the more distant from us, which leads us to work harder to suppress it.</p><p>But who knows? Perhaps the process could work in reverse. Were we to start talking more about smells, perhaps we’d come to better appreciate them, leading us to ease up on our squelching of odors. And if we gave a closer look to other kinds of mess—well, it just might help relieve our increasing obsession with neatness and order.</p><p>Most people, no doubt, would be quicker to predict that society will inexorably push toward ever-higher standards of neatness and order, leaving us to keep striving for tighter schedules, more focused goals, better organized companies, tidier homes, longer-range planning, and more consistent behavior. But must it be so? Perhaps right now, somewhere in the world, a beaker has been overturned, or a corporate brainstorm has been sparked by a random word, or two papers have ended up next to each other on a messy desk, or an impulsive politician is changing her position—and the results are going to lead us down a surprising new path.</p><p>After all, you know how much stock to put in predictions.</p></div></body></html>
