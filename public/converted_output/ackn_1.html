Larry Kanter and the gang at <em>Inc.</em> magazine were gracious in adjusting assignments and deadlines in support of the book. Alex Kerr was briefly, but outstandingly, my research assistant. Laszlo Kish of Texas A&amp;M and Robert Levy of Lawrence University were among those who provided me with long and interesting interviews that didn’t make it into the book for structural reasons. On behalf of both Eric and myself, thanks to Sheena Iyengar for the lead on the magazine stores.</p><p>What luck to get Liz Nagle as an editor; she has from the first been hugely supportive, wise, and attentive. Marie Salter added a great many nice touches. Any surviving mistakes or awkwardnesses are my fault alone. Rick Balkin is nominally my agent, but that doesn’t begin to get at the breadth of his contribution. My children, Rachel, Alex, and Jason, refused to let me get bogged down, plus they contributed tangibly to one section of a chapter each. And in addition to all the normal lines of support one would hope to get from a significant other, my wife, Laurie, was good for a stream of invaluable ideas, information, contacts, and criticism. She’s messy, too. (Where else could I say that as a compliment?)</p><p class="ca">—DHF</p></div></body></html>
