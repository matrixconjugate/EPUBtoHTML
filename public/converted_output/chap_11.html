There, at a scrubby site, the observers swing their portable telescopes to and fro at nebulae, star clusters, and galaxies while the temperature plummets and coyotes jeer from the distance. When the observers train their lenses on a particularly hard-to-see galaxy poised to disappear below the horizon, the more experienced members of the group do something surprising. They jiggle their telescopes. You might have thought that someone struggling to discern the elusive, wispy whorl of a distant galaxy through an eyepiece would seek utter stillness. But, as one of the astronomers explains it, a faint object is sometimes easier to make out in a telescope not when the object is fixed and stared at, but when it’s dashing around the observer’s field of vision.</p><p>People tend to imagine that they are getting the most out of their brains when their thoughts are well organized and focused, when they are able to clearly spell out their goals and intentions, and when the confusing world around them has been sorted out according to a distinct scheme. But actually, the mind is built around disorder on several levels, ranging from the processing of raw sensory data to the juggling of complex ideas. Our brains evolved to function in a messy world, and sometimes when we insist on thinking in neat, orderly ways, we’re really holding back our minds from doing what they do best. In fact, it is when our brains seem to be efficiently putting the world around us into perfect order that they are most likely to be leading us astray.</p><p class="h1">Random Brilliance</p><p class="p1">A Web-marketing consultant named Steve Nelson was brainstorming with managers from a car insurance company when the group became stuck in its efforts to come up with a theme for a new advertising campaign. None of the ideas that had been kicked around seemed satisfying, and no one seemed to have any additional ones to suggest. Car insurance marketing is a constrained subject; the insurance is always sold on the basis of price, convenience, and claims support. The company was hoping to take a different tack, but the team kept circling back to the same old approaches. After a minute or so of heavy silence, Nelson reached into his briefcase, pulled out a stack of handmade cards, and asked a manager to pick one and read it out loud. “Blue,” read the manager. Okay, blue, said Nelson. Let’s work with that.</p><p>Blue. Sad. Feelings. Happiness. Fear. Fear of what? Fear of...car accidents. Who’s afraid of car accidents? Mothers are afraid of car accidents. Sell to mothers, instead of to men looking for price, convenience, and claims support? Sell on what? Helping them to not be afraid of car accidents? Helping them to not <em>have</em> car accidents. Safety. Sell on safety. Provide safe-driving tips. A car insurance company that helps its customers avoid accidents by encouraging them to drive more safely.</p><p>The safe-driving campaign ended up a big hit. A single random word had helped kick off a shift in the team’s thinking from aiming at the traditional buyers of car insurance to targeting a different influencer in the household with a pitch that resonated. Nelson, as it turns out, is a big fan of the power of random words; he’s the founder of BananaSlug, the search engine mentioned in chapter 10 that adds a random word to search terms. Though his day job is helping to run Clear Ink, the digital marketing firm he cofounded, Nelson is a former programmer and likes to keep his hand in it by developing various software projects as a hobby. He’s written computer games and put together other Web sites for fun, including SpellWeb, which enlists the Web to gauge the relative popularity of two different terms or of two different spellings of the same word. In 2003, when he was casting about for a new project, a ukulele-playing friend happened to mention that he found it difficult to uncover interesting Web sites about ukuleles via a Google search, because the pages that came up near the top of the search results were too generic, the full list of some two million pages was far too big to browse, and he couldn’t think of a useful way to narrow down the list. Nelson suggested just randomly adding an interesting word to the Google search, and the results proved so satisfying that Nelson created BananaSlug. (The Fighting Banana Slug is the mascot at Nelson’s alma mater, the University of California at Santa Cruz.) Of course, another way to find the most interesting Web sites is to have experts exhaustively search them out and put them in a list, which is how BananaSlug came to be named one of the top one hundred Web sites by <em>PC Magazine</em> in 2005.</p><p>Why does adding a random word to a Web search produce more interesting results? Nelson suggests it does so for three reasons. First, it adds an element of “relevant surprise,” in that a Web site that prominently incorporates a random word will probably address a topic that strays from the focus you had in mind—but will still have some relevance to you, because it also prominently incorporates your search term. Second, it’s more likely to pull up unusual Web sites, because a Web site that manages to address two concepts that have little to do with one another will probably be at least a bit idiosyncratic. (To avoid bland random words that goose the results a bit, BananaSlug offers a choice of categories of more colorful random words, including animals, themes from Shakespeare, and urban dictionary.) Third, it will probably pull up a varied group of Web sites, because whatever odd link a Web site finds between two different concepts is not likely to be the same link found by another Web site. “If you’re searching for, I don’t know, tennis stars, and you add the random word <em>poodle,</em> you’re probably going to get a pretty interesting group of sites,” says Nelson. (He had randomly tossed this example off the top of his head, but it turns out to be nicely illustrative. On a straight Google search for tennis players, the first sixty results are almost all lists of players. When <em>poodle</em> is thrown in, the fourth entry is about a book on the nature of consciousness, the fifth is an interview with David Bowie’s bass player, and the thirteenth an article on the mathematics of wobbly tables. BananaSlug search results are often weirdly compelling in this way.)</p><p>Nelson is hardly the first to suggest enlisting random concepts to free up creativity. In fact, “seeding” brainstorming and other idea-generation efforts with random, unrelated, or randomly combined ideas is virtually doctrine in a substantial creativity industry comprising consultants, books, software, and Web sites. The essence of the creativity problem, as Nelson explains it, is that it’s easy for a person’s thinking to get into a rut, and simply trying to think her way out of it may be no more effective than a car’s wheels spinning in the mud. Innovation expert Robert Sutton, the Stanford professor mentioned in chapter 1, advocates random input into task solving, putting it this way in his book, <em>Weird Ideas That Work:</em> “No matter how hard people try not to think about their past experiences, irrational prejudices, and personal preferences, much research shows that these and a host of other biases have powerful effects.” Meditating on almost anything that’s not directly related to the problem at hand can serve to yank you away from these biases and out of a creativity rut; random inputs happen to work well because they’re almost guaranteed to be unrelated. A random cue, in other words, defocuses the mind and serves as an antidote to consistent thinking—focus and consistency often being the enemies of creativity.</p><p>Although tossing a random concept into your brainstorming may pull you out of a thinking rut, it won’t necessarily plunk you directly down on a fruitful conceptual path. It could easily—and in fact probably will—lead you to a new dead end, in which case you can try a new random concept. But even though you can’t count on serendipity, it’s more likely to find those who are open to disorder. Working off-the-subject words or concepts into your thinking is simply one way to prompt discovery. Messy behavior is another, as proved true for Alexander Fleming when he stumbled on penicillin. And Fleming’s serendipitous breakthrough was far from unique; messy lab work has often led to major scientific insights. The 2000 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the discovery of electrically conductive plastics was the culmination of a scientific trail that began when a researcher managed to mismeasure the amount of one ingredient in a chemical mixture by a factor of 1000. The first Nobel Prize in physics was awarded for X-rays, discovered when Wilhelm R�en happened to notice a mysteriously glowing screen in his laboratory after he had been promiscuously shooting electrons around the area. Another physics Nobel went to two Bell Labs researchers who stumbled on a strange, staticky radio signal that they later determined is the leftover radiation from the Big Bang that gave birth to the universe. Charles Goodyear came up with the process for vulcanizing rubber after a pot boiled over on his stove. According to the ten hits from a search of “discovered by accident” combined with the random word <em>companion</em> at BananaSlug—more manageable than Google’s 98,800 results for “discovered by accident”—other discoveries prompted by random events include that of nylon, an asteroid spotted in 2002 that shares the Earth’s orbit, LSD, polyethylene, and the artificial sweeteners saccharin, cyclamate, aspartame, and sucralose.</p><p>Clearly our minds are prepared to do some of their best work when they’re diverted, one way or another, from what we intend to focus them on. Think about that—but only for a minute.</p><p class="h1">Mentally Neatening the World</p><p class="p1">No matter how messy the world is, we humans seem determined not to see it that way. We enlist all sorts of schemes to avoid having to accept disorder and randomness, but when viewed logically these appear to be glitches in our software. A few examples:</p><p class="spb"><strong>Fabricating Justice</strong> Psychologists have long been aware that people tend to assume anyone who suffers a misfortune probably deserved it in some way, a phenomenon known as the <em>just-world hypothesis.</em> The man who dropped dead of a heart attack at forty-five must not have been fit; the woman who was raped was probably engaging in risky behavior; the homeless person must not have really wanted to get a job. The notion that terrible things can befall utterly innocent people, which of course happens all the time, is one that forces us to confront the messiness and randomness of life, and we manufacture excuses to deny it.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Neatening Sights and Sounds</strong> Our brains are uncomfortable with visual disorder, or so it would seem, considering how hard it is to look at an ink blot or a cloud without making out a figure of some sort. And filmmakers know that a movie soundtrack doesn’t have to be precisely keyed to the action on the screen for the audience to perceive it that way; in fact, even a random tune played along with a film will seem synchronized to it.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Rashomonic Memory</strong> Most of us have had the experience of learning from a relative or friend that an event we’ve long remembered with perfect clarity did not in fact take place in that way, or at all. Our memories aren’t precise recordings of what we’ve taken in from the world; rather, they are heavily massaged tableaux constructed by our brains based partly on reality and partly on what we need, want, or expect reality to be—a way of retroactively neatening the world. That this process can produce heavily flawed recollections is borne out vividly in National Transportation Safety Board reports of investigations into airplane accidents, which often detail highly conflicting eyewitness accounts. People tend to be utterly unfamiliar with the sights and sounds of a struggling aircraft—unlike the experience of car accidents—and the brain, having no useful template by which to sort things out, apparently assembles an inaccurate scenario that the brain’s owner will nonetheless cling to with utter conviction.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Neatening Chance</strong> Where would you rather put your quarter? In a slot machine that just now paid out $1,000 or in an identical machine that has been fed hundreds of quarters since it last paid out big? Most people would go for the second machine, intuiting that the machine is “due” to pay out. But that’s flawed reasoning. Slot machines are meticulously designed so that every pull of the lever or press of the button provides exactly the same odds of paying out as a pull or press on any other machine of the same model. The pattern of payouts is for all practical purposes completely random, and there’s no useful information to be gleaned from past payouts when it comes to picking the “right” time to drop in a coin.</p><p>Part of the problem is that the public tends to have a poor understanding of probability and how it plays out in real-world situations. For example, many people would figure that if five coin tosses in a row result in heads, it’s more likely than not that the next one will yield tails, though of course the odds are really always fifty-fifty. But for gamblers, there’s another phenomenon in force. Gamblers are highly prone to thinking that they can give themselves an edge in whatever game they’re playing and readily adopt distorted views of the world in order to guard their belief that they can profitably assert order over randomness. According to James Whelan, a University of Memphis psychology professor who codirects the school’s Institute for Gambling Education and Research, dedicated slot-machine players become so convinced that the machine into which they’ve been popping coins is due to pay out that some players will wet themselves rather than take a bathroom break and risk having another player reap the supposedly imminent payout.</p><p class="p3">The belief that you should stick with a machine that hasn’t paid off in a while is a crude form of a gambler’s <em>system</em>—a scheme of play that enables one to see gambling as less subject to randomness in general and to unfavorable odds in particular. Some systems are simple and straightforward, such as always betting on the favorite in a horse race, while others can be more involved. John Grochowski, a gambling-odds expert who writes widely on casino games, has described this roulette system, for example:</p><p class="ext1">One close friend likes to extend play at roulette by betting on black plus an equal amount on the third column. Eight of the numbers in the third column are red, so my friend covers 26 of the 38 numbers—all 18 black numbers plus eight red. If a black in the first two columns shows up, he breaks even, winning on black but losing the column bet. If one of his eight reds turns up, he makes a one-unit profit, winning a 2–1 payoff on the column while losing on black. But if the ball lands on one of the four third-column blacks, he wins triple—even money on black, plus 2–1 column.</p><p class="ext3">Of course, there’s the pesky matter of the 10 red numbers he doesn’t cover, plus 0 and 00. Any of those dozen numbers bring a double loss.</p><p class="spb">This may not make much sense if you’re unfamiliar with roulette, but you can get the larger point: a system can enlist various betting gymnastics to obscure the essential fact that no matter what you do, the odds are against you in the long run. In the case of roulette, as Grochowski notes, the odds are tilted 1.0526 to 1 toward your eventually losing <em>regardless of how you bet.</em> (Unless you also throw in a so-called basket bet on 0, 00, 1, 2, and 3, in which case the odds are worse.)</p><p>Whelan and his colleagues at the institute have studied gamblers and their systems at some length. He notes, for one thing, that gambling systems are often based on erroneous and irrational beliefs that are encased in assumptions with a more factual basis. A prominent example is blackjack card counting, which in its simple, most popular form involves keeping mental track of how many cards with a value of ten have been played since the deck was last shuffled; if the number becomes unusually high or low, that knowledge can indeed be used to improve the chances of certain bets paying off. But what amateur card counters typically remain resolutely blind to is the simple fact that while counting can improve the odds by a fraction of a percent, it isn’t enough to put the odds in the player’s favor; the game remains a losing proposition by roughly half a percent, depending on the casino’s rules and the player’s ability to adhere to perfect strategy. (There are more complex forms of card counting that can in theory tip the balance in the player’s favor by up to 1 percent, but they require extensive training, facility with numbers, and confederates to disguise your betting patterns, since casinos will toss you out and may even ban you if they catch you at expert card counting.) Another popular system that can be applied to almost any sort of gambling involves temporarily increasing the size of your bet every time you lose, under the correct reasoning that doing so can in theory counteract any losing streak by ensuring that when a winning bet finally comes in it can be large enough to put you back into the black. The flaw in this case is that eventually a freakishly long losing streak will require such a large bet to make it up—the number can easily climb into the thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars—that the player will run out of money, or the house will refuse a bet that large, leaving the player with a potentially astronomical loss. Some players enlist the simple system of riding winning streaks until they end, in the hopes of gaining maximum advantage from them, while others adopt a policy of always walking away in the middle of winning streaks, to avoid giving the gains back to the house, though neither strategy will alter in the slightest the odds of winning over the long term.</p><p>In the end, all permissible gambling strategies are flawed and fail to erase the casino’s, racetrack’s, bookie’s, or lottery commission’s edge. And yet, notes Whelan, gamblers not only have faith in their systems, they also become wrongly convinced that their records of earnings and losses bear that faith out. That’s because of a psychological phenomenon known as a <em>confirmation bias:</em> when a person wants and expects something to be true, he tends to pay special attention to and to remember whatever confirms the expectation and is more likely to ignore or forget what contradicts it. In other words, the brain steps in and tidies up our view of the world so that it jibes with how we expect the world to behave. Whelan and his colleagues have performed studies in which they compare gamblers’ actual wins and losses to what the gamblers report at the end of six months. “Gamblers are very reliable when it comes to reporting on how many days they gambled, which days they gambled, what games they played, and almost everything else about their gambling,” he says. “The one thing they seem to have a really hard time remembering accurately is how much they won or lost. The vast majority reports results that are highly biased toward winning.” (Whelan notes that when he drives his daughter to school in the morning, they adopt a system of “thinking green” in order to influence traffic lights, and he reports it seems to help.) Heavy gamblers are more likely to believe in systems than are occasional gamblers, Whelan has found, and hang on to the beliefs more tenaciously. In fact, contrary to popular belief, casinos welcome the simple version of card counting at blackjack tables, knowing that the more gamblers are convinced they can overcome the randomness of a game through a system, the more they will gamble. That’s why some casinos <em>teach</em> card counting. Even educating heavy gamblers about the irrationality of and flaws in their systems doesn’t seem to help them control their gambling, Whelan discovered in one study.</p><p>The brain’s proclivity for gambling systems is probably a side effect of what may have evolved as a sometimes helpful hitch in our powers of reasoning, suggests Whelan. If we were always good at recognizing our powerlessness to control randomness—that is, if we fully accepted how disordered the world is—we might too often become paralyzed by indecision or hopelessness. Being quick to imagine that we can assert order and improve the odds to a greater degree than we actually can is what often inspires us to act boldly. The entrepreneur who starts up a new restaurant, the infantryman who kicks down a door in an insurgent hot zone, the comet-hunter who wakes at 3:00 a.m. to sweep her telescope across the sky, the CEO who engages in strategic planning—in each case there is, to a greater or lesser degree, an element of casting a blind eye to uncontrollable randomness. The line between foolishness and adventurousness is sometimes drawn after the fact. Fred Smith, the founder and CEO of FedEx, has celebratedly claimed that he owes the rescue of his then nascent, money-losing company from near bankruptcy in 1974 to a winning night of blackjack in Las Vegas. Too bad he wasn’t able to share his system with the thousands of foolish gamblers who lost their shirts that night.</p><p class="h1">Categorize This</p><p class="p1">As almost any parent can attest, a five-month-old infant need only run into two or three dogs before he has formulated a mental category for them, to store alongside the categories of caregivers, strangers, food, and toys. At first, dogs might be lumped in with all animals in the infant’s mind, but soon dogs, cats, squirrels, and other intriguing creatures are all given their own subcategories. We are literally born categorizers and for good reason; there isn’t enough time when we encounter each new entity in the world to go through the process of carefully observing and analyzing it so that we can finally decide if we need to pet it, eat it, flee from it, or smile at it. How much more efficient to quickly determine what easily flagged characteristics certain entities have in common, come up with some useful generalizations about this group of entities, and then apply those generalizations to every new entity that seems to fit. It’s got four legs, fur, a wagging tail, floppy ears—that’s enough to know you’re probably going to get sniffed and licked and maybe snapped at, too, if you pull too hard on one of those ears.</p><p>The urge to categorize hardly abates as we grow older. An eleven-year-old is virtually a categorization engine, wrestling with in-groups and out-groups at school, and then coming home to sort out a baseball-card collection or a scrapbook. Grown and employed, we rely on categorization throughout the day in our jobs as we file, departmentalize, hire the winners, and fire the losers, leaving the office at the end of the day to catch a museum exhibit of impressionism, expressionism, fauvism, or Dadaism. It’s surprising what some people will take the trouble to categorize. The Kama Sutra offers a typology not only of lovemaking positions, but also of love scratches, including the half-moon, the tiger’s claw, the peacock foot, and the hare’s leap. Northwestern University’s medical school has long maintained a carefully organized collection of some 170 “anomalous” fetuses. There are museums of lawn mowers and of toilet-seat art.</p><p>While it’s hard to imagine how we’d get through the day without relying on our sorting skills, categorization is not without drawbacks. It can be used as an instrument of irrational prejudice, for example. Physiognomics, or the characterization of personality and character types via measurements of the face and body, was once a respected science in some quarters, and under Nazi rule it was applied murderously. Our interest in categorizing can lead us to view the world in oversimplified ways, as when political candidates become regarded primarily as liberals or conservatives. As soon as we put an entity in one category, we risk failing to notice its potential utility in another one. Stick a book in the business section of a bookstore, for example, and readers who aren’t specifically interested in business aren’t likely to find it, no matter how much nonbusiness material is in it. And, as with all forms of order, categorization can be frustratingly relative. The directors of the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, DC, went through the trouble of seeking input from the members of twenty-four different tribes as to how items relating to their tribes should be grouped and annotated. On their advice, the items, which range from dolls and animals to tobacco and corn, are displayed not by typical artifact categories of strict chronology or historical events but, rather, by their significance to tribal stories and beliefs, and are supplemented by a range of information from computers and tribal members at hand around the exhibits. The museum opened in 2004 to a blast of largely scathing reviews from experts who were appalled at the unconventional categorization of items. <em>New York Times</em> critic Edward Rothstein called the exhibit style “pure pap,” explaining on National Public Radio: “I would wager that there are any number of scholars of American Indian history who know far more about these tribes than the elders of the tribe.”</p><p>A good example of the sort of problems that categorization can cause is one that has become a signature annoyance of modern life: the voice menus that businesses and other organizations make you wend your way through when you call them. A Forrester Research study concluded in 2005 that fourteen out of fifteen companies’ automated voice-response systems deserve a flunking grade. Another study indicated that a mere 16 percent of callers felt “completely satisfied” after calling with a problem, while a whopping 73 percent felt “customer <em>rage.</em>” (Given that many of us are making these sorts of calls on cell phones in cars, perhaps we can guess how some of that rage manifests itself.) If companies’ Web sites are doing a better job, customers don’t know it; according to a study by technology consultancy Gartner, customers with a problem are three times more likely to call up than visit the organization’s Web site, and of those who do try the Web, nearly two-thirds will give up and call anyway. In other words, those detested voice menus have become the primary means by which customers communicate with companies. Businesses see this as a real dilemma—or at least they ought to. On the one hand, a call involving a live agent is at least five times as expensive on average as one handled by a voice-response system, according to Forrester. On the other hand, companies whose voice systems enrage customers are being penny-wise and pound-foolish, given that studies have shown that up to half the callers who end up dissatisfied decide to take their business elsewhere.</p><p>The problem with voice menus is that they are crude categorization engines, intended to get you to quickly characterize yourself as needing one of several neatly defined types of assistance. That’s swell when your needs fit into one of the menu’s main categories. If you want directions to a store and its business hours, for example, no problem—just press 3, and you’re taken care of. That’s why the ATM machine, another type of categorization engine, has become a model of self-service; almost everyone who uses one either wants to get cash or make a deposit, so the machine can be designed to gracefully handle those neatly defined chores. The breakdown occurs when a customer feels her need doesn’t fit neatly into any of the menu options. Say, for example, you want to change the address to which your phone company sends its bills or report that the silverware set you bought has too many spoons and not enough forks. Businesses can’t fit the dozens or thousands of different types of possible customer-service requests into a voice menu, or even come close, without forcing customers to slog through multiple levels of choices likely to leave them confused, stuck, and unassisted. That’s why the end result is typically the one considered the worst of all possible worlds: the bailout, or the request to speak to a live agent.</p><p>The frequency at which voice-menu systems run into categorization failure leading to bailout can be surprising. You’d think, for example, that asking customers to categorize themselves geographically by punching in their zip codes would be a no-brainer. But Marco Pacelli, who runs a company called ClickFox that specializes in fine-tuning customer-response systems, discovered that about a fifth of one client’s customers were bailing out of a voice-response system at the zip-code request. As it turns out, even zip codes don’t make for a neat category; people calling from their offices are often confused about whether to enter their business or home zip codes. And it’s downhill from there.</p><p>It’s not a trivial problem. When a customer bails out of an automated system, the organization has not only failed to save agent costs, it has also irritated the customer before the agent says “hello.” Yet customer expectations of being quickly and usefully categorized by voice-menu systems are so low that 37 percent of people who reach one of them press 0 immediately, according to a 2004 study by market research firm Harris Interactive. The popularity of this sort of preemptive bailout has led to an escalating battle between instant bailers and companies that don’t want callers bailing out before giving the system a chance. To prevent instant bailing, many businesses simply take away the zero option; if you press 0, you’re told it’s not a valid option. But there’s almost always <em>some</em> way to get the system to kick a caller to an agent, and many callers become determined to figure out what it is. There are even extensive cheat sheets posted on the Web that list the sequence of button-pushes and spoken phrases needed to bypass the voice systems for a surprisingly large number of organizations. You can get past the Fidelity NetBenefits voice menu, for example, by first pressing 1, and then pressing # up to seventeen times. Barking “help” repeatedly every time the system asks for input does the trick on the Sears repair line. For Cellular One, press 4, say “agent,” then press #. (<em>Tip:</em> ignore any admonishments from a system that your responses are invalid or not understood; the system is usually keeping track.)</p><p>But bailout, whether premature or not, isn’t just a problem for organizations hoping to save on agent costs. It’s also often a loss for the caller. That’s because voice menus typically have a secondary purpose beyond trying to serve a customer entirely automatically—namely, to determine what <em>sort</em> of agent, out of a field of many specialists, is most likely to be able to solve the customer’s problem when the system can’t solve it. Partly because of premature bailout, but also because voice-menu systems simply aren’t very good at getting customers to usefully self-categorize, customers often get to a live agent only to find themselves in a second level of hell. Studies show that once customers with complaints are transferred to a person, there’s a 50 percent chance they’ll be transferred a second time—at which point the chances that they’ll decide never to do business with the company again jump by 30 percent.</p><p>One solution is for a business to try to at least roughly categorize callers before the voice-menu system answers the phone. That can sometimes be accomplished automatically by matching the caller ID against customer databases to check on the customer’s profile and history. For example, an insurance company’s system could distinguish between an existing customer who recently filed a claim and thus probably wants to check on its status, a customer who hasn’t recently filed a claim and thus is likely to want to either file one or to update his policy, and a caller who isn’t in the database at all and thus must be a prospective customer. Armed with this first level of categorization, the company could then provide a short and more relevant menu to the caller, and if the caller bails out, the company can pass the call on to the sort of agent most likely to be able to help. In some cases, the organization may not even want a prescreened caller to have a shot at a voice menu, because the organization and the caller may have differing ideas of how the caller should be categorized. Take, for example, a well-heeled bank customer who calls in with the intention of self-categorizing as someone who wants to check account balances; the bank, on the other hand, may prefer to categorize this caller as someone who needs a little quality time with a salesperson in the mutual funds department. One study found that high-value credit-card customers are 30 percent more likely than other cardholders to ditch their card company over being kept on hold. So the next time you’re forced to spend twenty minutes waiting to get through to an agent at a company, you wouldn’t be paranoid to suspect that customers whose business the company values more highly than yours are getting through right away.</p><p>In most cases, though, callers can’t be precategorized with much precision or reliability. After all, Wal-Mart has no good way of guessing why someone is calling, regardless of what they might have recently purchased. For most organizations, then, little can be done to greatly improve their voice-menu systems, other than biting the bullet, getting rid of the systems, and restoring the answering of phones to well-trained human agents capable of handling callers’ messy requests and needs.</p><p class="h1">Listening to Your Inner Mess</p><p class="p1">For anyone outside the science world looking in, it’s easy to get the impression that progress happens steadily, through the purposeful collaboration of scientists forging ahead along a grandly envisioned path. In fact, though, science itself is more often a big mess, lurching along in fits and starts, plunging headlong into dead ends here, unexpectedly bursting into fruit there. Not only is what ultimately seems to be the right path rarely envisioned ahead of time, it may in fact be just retroactively, after decades of work and many chance encounters and other random connections, that anyone realizes there had ever been any sort of path at all.</p><p>A good example of the disordered progress of science is that of the study of disorder or at least of a contemporary branch of it. It’s a branch that owes much to Frank Moss, a bearded, chunky, and—unusually for his field—folksily spoken physicist at the University of Missouri in St. Louis. Moss used to study the behavior of low-temperature fluids, but by 1979 he had become bored with the field and took a sabbatical in the hopes of rekindling his excitement for the scientific hunt. Leafing desultorily through a random collection of research papers, Moss, then forty-six, stumbled on an obscure one from a group of Belgian researchers that set off a spark for him, though he couldn’t at first say why. The paper theorized that adding randomness could make a physical system work better. Though the paper didn’t identify any such systems, the theory seemed plausible enough to Moss. After all, Einstein’s work on Brownian motion had long since been expanded and applied to the world of high finance, to the extent that a cornerstone of the global economy was the ability to consistently make vast sums of money every day on the movements of markets, not in spite of the essential randomness of the markets but <em>because</em> of it. If randomness could be made to pay off there, why not in physical systems?</p><p>Actually, there had been glimpses over the years of disorder’s potential utility in the world of things. Some photographers knew, for example, that a picture taken in low light would sometimes stand out more clearly if the image was superimposed over that of a busy random background. And the designers of early radios had found that slightly mistuning them increased the static background but also brought in the music more clearly. These happy-noise observations—<em>noise,</em> that is, in the technical sense of a disordered signal—were very much the exception, though, and regarded as little more than curiosities. The engineering world’s attitude toward noise was clearly established in the 1930s when electrical engineers were trying to perfect the vacuum tube, which enlisted a hot stream of electrons to amplify a weak electronic signal. As the tubes became increasingly sensitive, engineers listening to the results over loudspeakers began to hear an odd sound in the background, reminiscent of bursts of rain landing on a tin roof or of a load of shotgun pellets clattering into a wall, a baffling sound dubbed <em>shot noise.</em> Shot noise turned out to result from the random motion of electrons, analogous to the random molecular surges that cause a grain of pollen to dance in water; the engineers were literally listening to disorder. <em>Noise</em> eventually became a generic term for random signals, by which time it had already been declared an enemy of electronics so that ever since circuits have been designed to minimize it.</p><p>Mulling over the Belgian paper, Moss wondered if there might be systems that demonstrate noise can be helpful in ways that had been overlooked. Plowing through stacks of obscure scientific journals, he finally stumbled on his system: turtle eggs. A paper described how outside temperature can determine whether the eggs of the European pond turtle produce male or female hatchlings. If the temperature were to remain steady, or vary more in one direction than in the other, broods would tend to be all of one sex, placing the species in an awkward position. Fortunately for the pond turtle, temperature usually fluctuates fairly randomly, leaving the turtles with mixed-sex broods. Moss was struck by the apparent fact that the turtles had evolved not merely to withstand noise but had actually come to depend on it for the survival of the species. “I knew right then and there what I wanted to do with my career,” he says. Moss crammed his modest laboratory with vintage analog electronic equipment of the sort that increasingly digitally minded engineers and physicists were eager to dump; the older equipment had good old-fashioned knobs that could be delicately twisted to dial in just the right sort of noise. (Designer noise comes in colors: a slowly fluctuating signal is called <em>red noise; blue noise</em> is a signal that rapidly fluctuates; <em>pink noise</em> is a combination of red and blue noise; and <em>white noise</em> is a broad mixture of all sorts of fluctuations.) Moss became one of the world’s experts on noisy electronic circuits, attracting funding from the U.S. Navy, which is always looking for ways to improve its ability to electronically detect and hide the noisy signals left by submarines against a literal sea of other noise.</p><p>In 1982, a second theoretical shot was fired on behalf of useful noise by an Italian group trying to figure out what triggered ice ages every hundred thousand years. The onsets tended to coincide with a wobble in the Earth’s orbit that occasionally brought the Earth farther from the sun, but calculations clearly indicated that this variation was too small to effect a major climate change. Their conclusion: climatic noise, in the form of random temperature fluctuations from changing ocean patterns and other weather systems, is amplifying the effect of the orbital wobble.</p><p>That a random signal could amplify a weak, ordered one seems as counterintuitive as the notion of enhancing a piano sonata by inviting a cat to walk across the keyboard, or indiscriminately grabbing spices off a shelf to improve a delicate sauce. But picture the sort of heavy, wall-mounted electric switch that mad scientists’ assistants are always dramatically throwing in old horror movies. Now imagine that the assistant needs to throw the switch back and forth repeatedly in order to make his master’s experiment work—but the switch is sticking, and the assistant is too weak, by a hair, to get the job done. Suddenly an earthquake strikes, randomly heaving the room this way and that, while the assistant continues to struggle to push the switch back and forth. It’s not hard to imagine that some of the heaves will provide just the extra oomph needed to enable the assistant to throw the switch one way, and others will allow him to throw it back. Most of the heaves will do the assistant no good, of course, but that doesn’t really matter, as long as there’s a good chance that <em>some</em> of the heaves will be useful and that the other, useless heaves won’t interfere with the task. That’s the essence of <em>stochastic resonance,</em> as the Italian climatologists named the phenomenon. A noisy signal occasionally randomly lines up with a regular signal to get the job done, and when the two don’t line up no harm is done.</p><p>Moss wondered, could stochastic resonance be important in other systems? A colleague in a naval research institute had asked Moss to help him create electronic circuits that mimicked the way groups of brain cells “fired” in response to certain signals. Moss suggested trying to get stochastic resonance to work in these brainlike circuits. Sure enough, adding noise to the original signal made the artificial brain cells ten times as sensitive to the signal. Though the experiment seemed far afield from anything neuroscientists were working on, Moss’s colleague presented the results at a neuroscience conference. When he put up a slide showing an unusually shaped graph of how the artificial neurons fired in response to the noise-enhanced signal, one researcher in the audience leaped to his feet and shouted, “I’ve seen that diagram before!” As it turned out, the idiosyncratic graph was identical to graphs that had come out of research over the past two decades into the way the brains of monkeys and cats recognize flashing lights and audio tones. Researchers had long been puzzled by the unusual nature of the firing pattern of these actual brain cells. In particular, no one had been able to explain why the cells didn’t always immediately fire when exposed to a flashing light; sometimes they didn’t fire until the second or even the third flash. Moss was able to offer a simple explanation: if the firing relied on stochastic resonance, with its strong component of randomness, then you would expect the firings to be a bit hit or miss.</p><p>But where in the brain would the noise needed for stochastic resonance come from? One set of experiments later provided a possible answer, at least in the case of hearing. In the leopard frog, the fine, hairlike structures in the inner ear called cilia, responsible for turning the mechanical energy of sound into electrical impulses for brain cells, vibrate not only in response to external sounds but are also tossed about by the Brownian motion of the molecules in the fluid around them. When experimenters damped or enhanced this random signal, the auditory brain cells connected to the cilia stopped firing in the presence of sound. Apparently, the frog’s auditory system has evolved to depend critically on exactly the level and type of disorder naturally found in the fluid of the inner air. Moss himself suspects the brain actually <em>manufactures</em> noise in some cases to help stochastic resonance along. That remains to be proved, though he notes that in one study researchers found that human ear cilia churn out about ten times more noise than would be expected. “Noise is ubiquitous in neurons,” he says. “Wherever you stick a probe in, you get noise.”</p><p>There have since been a number of studies suggesting that different types of noise in general, and stochastic resonance in particular, are important to brain functions, including the sensory systems of cats, crayfish, electric fish, and humans. One experiment, for example, demonstrated that people tend to be more adept at multiplication problems when exposed to auditory noise. Peter Tass of Germany’s Research Center J� widely considered one of the world’s foremost neuroscientists, has been using state-of-the-art brain scans to investigate the role stochastic resonance may play in the human visual system, along with the possibility that noise might somehow be enlisted to improve the impaired vision of stroke victims.</p><p>The notion of a medical prescription for noise is not as far-fetched as it may seem. Jim Collins, a biomedical engineering researcher at Boston University, had been thinking about applications for stochastic resonance when he came to consider the fact that about one in ten Americans over age sixty-five are seriously injured in falls every year, and some thirteen thousand of them die of complications from these injuries. Aside from the toll in suffering, it’s a $19 billion burden on the health care system, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control. One critical component of balance, Collins knew, is the transmission of sensory information, from the foot to the brain, about sudden instabilities, allowing the brain to dash off quick compensatory commands for leaning or foot repositioning. But that foot-to-brain signal weakens with age as nerves become less sensitive. Could stochastic resonance help? Collins constructed a vibrating platform and studied how well people balanced on it when it was set to mildly vibrate compared to when it was still. “The vibrations enabled seventy-five-year-olds to balance as well as twenty-three-year-olds,” says Collins. Working with a spin-off company called Afferent, Collins has helped design vibrating insoles for shoes that in early testing appear to provide the benefits of the vibrating platform. The insoles also seem to help diabetic patients feel the early onset of foot ulcers; because these patients often lose sensation in their feet, the ulcers frequently remain undiscovered until they’re untreatable, leading to some eighty thousand foot and leg amputations each year and to treatment costs of more than $4 billion a year in the United States alone. Collins says Afferent is even looking into shoewear that could improve balance for athletes and construction workers, as well as vibrating grips for golf and tennis rackets that would provide better ball control.</p><p class="spb">Knowing that the brain is not merely comfortable with but actually <em>thrives</em> on a background of disorder may make it a little less mysterious that cell-phone listeners are uncomfortable with silence, that children can knock out their homework in noisy homes, and that jiggling a telescope helps an observer pick out a faint object. Stochastic resonance might even provide another way of looking at how mess can play a useful role in daily life. When you invite a certain amount of disorder into your rooms, your job, and your calendar, you can reasonably hope that by sheer chance the random zigs and zags of mess will occasionally line up with your goals—furnishing you with, from a heap of papers on a desk, a document that connects two unrelated projects; steering you to the person who unexpectedly solves your problem; sending you down a tiny street past an unfamiliar store where you spot the item you didn’t even realize you needed so badly. Much of the time the mess won’t do a lot for you, of course. But how much will it really hurt?</p></div></body></html>
