All were told something they had trouble believing: Schwarzenegger didn’t have a schedule. He refused to make appointments except in unusual circumstances and always had. He lives what he calls “an improvisational lifestyle.” It didn’t mean you couldn’t get to see him; it meant that you called him up, and he was either free to meet with you just then or you called back another time. If he did meet with you, it might be for five minutes or five hours—he’d see how it went.</p><p>The public tends to see Schwarzenegger as a nattily dressed, highly disciplined, controlling man who appears to have carefully planned every moment in his increasingly influential life—and he encourages that view. But Schwarzenegger is a master at looking neat while keeping major aspects of his life steeped in mess. Planfulness and consistency have attained the status of commandments among most of those who aspire to professional success, and yet Schwarzenegger has overachieved through improvisation and inconsistency. Not everyone admires him, but it’s hard to argue that he’s not highly effective.</p><p>Schwarzenegger’s predilection for winging it goes back to his early bodybuilding career. When other weight lifters were focusing on set regimens of exercises that often left them plateauing short of their seam-splitting goals, Schwarzenegger pioneered an approach that called for constantly shaking up routines with random variation. The same philosophy that successfully swelled his pecs and lats has also helped swell his box-office draw, wallet, and political prospects. Schwarzenegger is a study in unpredictable, contradictory behavior. He’s a movie star/politician/entrepreneur/athlete; a sometimes brutish right-winger who married a Kennedy; a professed admirer of Hitler’s speeches and close friend of alleged Nazi war criminal Kurt Waldheim who has won two awards from the Simon Wiesenthal Center for support of its Holocaust studies; a blood-and-guts film star who has embraced comic roles; a self-confessed extreme party animal who has donated countless hours establishing fitness programs at inner-city schools; and now a populist governor who plays to the cameras and crowds while boasting of cutting back-room deals in his cigar-smoke-filled office-tent. Hardly the résumé of a man sticking to a plan. Schwarzenegger has certainly maintained long-term goals of attaining celebrity and power, but these goals are far too vague to be considered an organizational scheme.</p><p>Schwarzenegger’s messy formula for success has been highlighted by his short but spectacular political career. He went back and forth on deciding to run for governor, finally announcing his candidacy at the last minute. He held off until well into the race before formulating a platform, then came up with one that was a messy hodgepodge of incompatible-seeming principles and allegiances, leaving him a fiscally conservative Republican who offers qualified support for gay unions, abortion rights, gun control, and offshore oil-drilling bans. As governor, he has signed bills to protect animal rights and vetoed bills to raise the minimum wage. There has been considerable talk of a constitutional amendment that would let the foreign-born Schwarzenegger run for president, but even the possibility of a shot at the presidency doesn’t seem to have focused Schwarzenegger’s ambitions. Since becoming governor, he has already appeared in one film and has entered negotiations to appear in <em>Terminator 4.</em></p><p>By blending several types of mess—the time sprawl of not keeping a schedule, the improvisation in his commitments, the blurring of political and social boundaries, the inconsistency in his stances, the distraction in jumping between careers—Schwarzenegger has essentially fashioned himself as an easily customizable and recustomizable figure. He has managed to maintain a malleable public persona and a nimble agenda that’s easily adjusted to take advantage of unexpected opportunities and fast-changing, unpredictable situations. His refusal to lock himself into a worldview or set of easily categorized allegiances enables him to tailor each new stance to suit his needs. Almost anyone can find a way to feel in step with at least some aspect of Schwarzenegger’s eclectic, action-hero-garnished mix of views. In short, Schwarzenegger’s disordered approach to his professional life provides an excellent example of a major benefit of mess: flexibility.</p><p class="ext4"><em>Flexibility:</em> Messy systems adapt and change more quickly, more dramatically, in a wider variety of ways, and with less effort. Neat systems tend to be more rigid and slower to respond to changing demands, unexpected events, and new information.</p><p>Flexibility can emerge from any of the twelve different types of mess we discussed in the last chapter: clutter, mixture, time sprawl, improvisation, inconsistency, blur, noise, distraction, bounce, convolution, inclusion, and distortion. A few more examples:</p><p class="bl1">• Improvisation enables a group of jazz musicians to shift at any moment to address an audience’s response to the music, while a symphony orchestra is tied to the music as written. (Though not always as tightly as you might think, as we’ll see in chapter 13.)</p><p class="bl">• The blur of an organizational chart that doesn’t pin down employees into tightly defined specialties and responsibilities makes it easier to reconfigure resources around new challenges.</p><p class="bl3">• Good boxers keep bouncing around randomly between blows, not only making themselves harder to hit but also enabling them to create openings in their opponents’ defenses.</p><p>Messy people and organizations behave differently than neat ones—a difference that can provide advantages. A system that’s neat and orderly has to keep struggling to fight off randomness, and when randomness inevitably leaks in, the system is thrown off. Being open to a certain level of randomness, on the other hand, allows it to work in your favor. Specifically, messiness can confer six key benefits: flexibility, completeness, resonance, invention, efficiency, and robustness. We’ve considered flexibility; let’s look at some case studies that illustrate how the other five benefits of mess can emerge in practice.</p><p class="h1">Completeness: Awash in Useful Mess</p><p class="p1">People and organizations often embrace a bevy of filters and neatening schemes that they think renders a random, dense, cluttered world easier to deal with. But sometimes these schemes do more harm than good. It’s an idea that seems to have occurred, if at a purely intuitive level, to Harvey Katz in 1953, a few months after he returned from the Korean War. Katz is a big man, blunt and boisterous, and unafraid of competition. Good thing, because he had just opened up a hardware store in the small Boston suburb of Needham, and from his front window he could see seven other hardware stores in and around the town square. Hunting for an edge, Harvey noticed how many customers came by seeking odd items that none of the hardware stores in town, including his own, ever bothered to carry. Replacement handles for adzes, size 0-5 screws, eighteen-volt flashlight bulbs—no one could justify carrying items that might ring up a couple of sales a year. But on those rare occasions when Harvey did happen to have an item that the other stores in town didn’t, customers seemed especially grateful. More important, Harvey, who has a flawless memory when it comes to who buys what, noticed that those customers usually came back. A new strategy was forged: stock it all. It was an idea that flies in the face not just of fundamental economic theory but also of lemonade-stand-level business know-how. Who in their right mind would set out to clog a business with a glut of slow-moving inventory?</p><p>Harvey’s Hardware today looks quite neat on the outside. It’s adorned with a large wooden sign with gilded, hand-carved-looking letters—a sign that would be at home on a three-star restaurant or an artisan’s shop. But step inside, and you might think you’ve stumbled into a basement stockroom. Every square inch of shelf and wall space and the vast majority of floor space—even the ceiling—is crammed with a riotous mélange of wares, all of it jammed together, some of it so old the packaging is discolored. The aisles are narrow and asymmetrical and indistinguishably lined with tall, dense, unbroken shelving. What little space there is to walk through is made into an obstacle course by various wares stacked in unlabeled piles. The lighting is on the dim side. There are no aisle placards or any other store navigational aids, nor does any logical scheme of organization suggest itself. There is a prominent staircase leading to a lower floor but no hint of what might be down there, nor in an additional room that branches off on one side.</p><p>For all this mess, Harvey’s, which is no larger than a typical small-town hardware store, sells more than $2.5 million worth of hardware each year, compared with a little more than $900,000 for the average U.S. hardware store, according to the National Retail Hardware Association. People drive an hour or more to shop there, passing Home Depots and a dozen conventional hardware stores along the way. And Harvey’s doesn’t discount anything.</p><p>Harvey’s still adheres to the everything-under-the-sun philosophy. People with stubborn hard-water stains in their washing machines can always count on Harvey’s for a tube of Rover rust remover. Among the dense clutter can be found odd-size halogen bulbs and jumbo S hooks that clerks at other stores will swear don’t even exist. Manufacturers’ reps sometimes show up at the store armed with “planograms” that map out the most efficient and effective way to display their merchandise, but they end up walking away, shaking their heads, when they see that Harvey’s allots approximately half the minimum space per item that they need to work with. According to Harvey, the jammed-up feeling communicates the scope of the inventory and creates an ambience compatible with a hardware-buying frenzy. It must: Harvey’s packs in $113 worth of inventory per square foot, more than three times the average for hardware stores. Sales per square foot are $503, close to four times the average. In other words, not only does Harvey benefit from needing less space than others to offer an enormous selection of goods, but the goods apparently fly off the shelves faster because of it. The average customer purchase is nearly 50 percent larger than at other hardware stores, probably in part because when you shop for something at Harvey’s, you can’t help running across several novel items you didn’t know you needed.</p><p>A lot of inventory sits around for years unsold, but Harvey’s has turned the willingness to let quantities of merchandise gather dust into an advantage. For example, the store keeps part of its warehouse space filled with items needed for weather emergencies: pumps and hoses for rainstorms, shovels and ice melt for snow, and so forth. Those reserve inventories are never used to fill floor stock; they’re left untouched and ready for mobilization should a crisis arise. When heavy rains bring flooding once every few years, cleaning sump pumps off the shelves of every other store in eastern Massachusetts, the line of people waiting for pumps at Harvey’s snakes through every aisle in the store. Every customer gets one.</p><p>How do customers deal with the disorder they confront in the store? The fact is, you weren’t intended to make your own way through Harvey’s. Staff members are trained to greet customers who walk through the door, or any customer who pauses in an aisle, with an offer to help them find what they’re looking for and to provide home-repair advice. Other hardware stores—indeed, retailers in general—have become as neatly organized as Web sites, clearly annotating themselves throughout with aisle signs and shelf labels and brightly signed displays that allow customers to self-serve efficiently, and enabling businesses to keep a minimum of staff on hand, mostly to make sure everything stays neat and organized. But neat stores can’t be densely packed with inventory, so selection is limited, and good luck to customers who need assistance. Though labor costs at Harvey’s are higher than average, the store’s outsized revenues drown out those costs. Annual sales per full-time employee at the average U.S. hardware store are $102,000. At Harvey’s, they come out to $228,000. Of course, messiness can also lead to lower-than-usual labor costs, as with the Manhattan magazine store that profited simply by doing less organizing than its competitor. But Harvey’s is more concerned with the <em>space</em> cost of neatness than the <em>labor</em> cost of neatness—and additionally benefits from the appeal of its mess.</p><p>The staff at Harvey’s is so adept at keeping the mess under control that when the store finally computerized seven years ago with a system designed for hardware shops, Harvey and his employees found they couldn’t use three-quarters of the features built into the software. Why have a computer tell you when to reorder duct tape when an employee will tell you when you’re down to your last few rolls after grabbing one for a customer? Some inventory and ordering information is still scattered throughout the store in various paper files whose locations are known only to Harvey, but the store is never out of stock of anything. (Though things can get a little sticky when Harvey is on vacation.) By casting aside the typical filtering and neatening schemes and tolerating a high level of mess, Harvey’s has provided generations of grateful customers a form of completeness, in inventory and service, they can’t find elsewhere.</p><p class="p3">And what of those seven other, neater stores? Harvey’s drove them out of business, one by one.</p><p class="ext4"><em>Completeness:</em> Messy systems can comfortably tolerate an exhaustive array of diverse entities. Neat systems tend to whittle away at the quantity and diversity of elements, eliminating some that would have proved useful or even critical.</p><p class="p4">Completeness is usually a direct benefit of messiness in the form of inclusiveness—a resistance to the conventional process of paring down things for efficiency’s sake. Two other examples of how inclusiveness can pay off:</p><p class="bl1">• Restaurants and food distributors around the world know that when it comes to seafood, almost any chef’s or consumer’s need can be addressed at Tokyo’s Tsukiji fish market, a vast, sprawling conglomeration of small booths, tanks, and buckets from which three thousand tons of more than 450 different types of marine life are sold every day.</p><p class="bl3">• It’s common knowledge that Thomas Edison experimented exhaustively before hitting on a form of tungsten as an ideal filament for the lightbulb. But few realize how indiscriminate Edison was in trying out other materials. In fact, he spent years of his life trying to get a long-lasting glow out of almost every substance he could get his hands on, without worrying much about why some substances might be more likely to work than others. The list included not only every type of metal he could wrestle into filament form but also tar, hair, soot, lime, paper, and some six thousand forms of flora, including cotton, coconut shell, cork, and bamboo. If it sounds as if Edison may have cast his net ridiculously wide, bear in mind that Edison’s initial success came not with tungsten bulbs but with commercial bulbs containing filaments of cotton, bamboo, and paper.</p><p class="h1">Resonance: In Tune with the External</p><p class="p1">The world around us is messy. Inevitably, then, when we set up ourselves and our systems to be neat and orderly, we’re creating a sort of barrier, with high randomness on the outside and low randomness on the inside. But while the barrier may succeed in keeping out mess, it can also cut us off from the very aspects of the outside world that are critical to our success. A good example lies a block northeast of London’s bustling Paddington Station, where squats the sooty, sprawling complex of aged, halfheartedly ornate but not entirely graceless buildings that make up St. Mary’s Hospital. Tucked just inside the hospital’s courtyard, far from the main entrance, is a small doorway that leads to a narrow spiral staircase carrying a thin stream of harried hospital staff and resigned patients. Few make it as far as the fourth floor, where a translucent-windowed door leads to a small room that in turn leads into a cramped office overlooking the havoc on Praed Street below. What light makes it through the window grime reveals that the crowded office appears to function as a laboratory. A sort of desk-cum-lab-bench running along the wall under the windows offers a variety of surfaces and bins, all of it occupied haphazardly by teetering piles of petri dishes, test tubes lying helter-skelter on their sides, cigarettes, open books, pages of notes, newspapers, and a variety of odd implements and containers.</p><p>You might guess the lab’s occupant has just stepped out, but in fact he did so three-quarters of a century ago. This is Alexander Fleming’s bacteriological lab—reconstructed from photographs and preserved as a sort of museum—just as he left it when he went on vacation in late August 1928. When he returned on September 3, he was sorting through the clutter when he noticed that a small, ragged circle of mold had invaded one of the petri dish bacterial cultures. The staphylococci in the culture seemed to steer clear of the mold, describing a sort of bacteria-free moat. Intrigued, Fleming dragged the dish under a microscope and discovered penicillin.</p><p class="p3">Fleming probably routinely benefited from the messiness of his lab simply by virtue of the fact that not being neat saved time that he was able to put to better use. But far more important is that if Fleming hadn’t been messy, he probably wouldn’t have discovered penicillin. Disorder created connections—that is, <em>resonance</em>—between the lab and the world around it, as well as between the lab work and Fleming himself. If Fleming hadn’t left open petri dishes scattered by an open window before going on vacation, the mold that drifted in—possibly from an allergy lab downstairs—most likely wouldn’t have. What’s more, mess preserved and highlighted the unexpected development. Even if exposed to mold, a petri dish that had been neatly stored in a rack with many others might not have been noticed before it was cleaned. On the disordered desk, the contaminated dish with its antibacterial circular swath ended up sitting under Fleming’s nose. (And speaking of useful mess under Fleming’s nose, his only previous major contribution to science was the discovery of <em>lysozyme,</em> a mildly antibiotic substance found in various bodily fluids, which Fleming had found after sneezing on a bacterial sample.) Of the role that mess played in his discovery, Fleming himself had little doubt. Years later, as a group of scientists took Fleming on a tour of their spotless and well-organized lab, one of them wondered out loud what sort of amazing discoveries Fleming might have made in this sort of facility. “Not penicillin,” replied Fleming.</p><p class="ext1"><em>Resonance:</em> Mess tends to help a system fall into harmony with its environment and with otherwise elusive sources of information and change, deriving useful influence from them. Neatness tends to insulate a system from and remain at odds with such influences.</p><p>Other forms of mess that can produce resonance:</p><p class="bl1">• Noise, in the general sense of external random disturbances, is the type of mess most closely associated with resonance. Few people, for example, appreciated the fact that engine noise is a safety feature in cars until drivers of ultraquiet electric cars realized that pedestrians and bicyclists were sometimes slow to get out of the way because they didn’t hear the cars coming, a problem exacerbated by antilock brakes, which have nearly eliminated the warning sound of skidding tires.</p><p class="bl">• Improvisation can lead to resonance, too, as can be verified by any out-of-town visitor who has learned that the best way to connect with a city’s character and charms is to wander around, rather than hitting the standard tourist traps.</p><p class="bl3">• Resonance can even come from time sprawl: enemy troops can time movements to fall between the easily predicted passes of overhead reconnaissance satellites, so the Pentagon knows to occasionally task distant satellites to provide random peeks at the action for a more reliable sense of what’s going on.</p><p class="h1">Invention: Creative Disorder</p><p class="p1">Anyone who has ever sat down in front of a blank sheet of paper and tried to force creativity knows that inspiration doesn’t usually happen that way. Rather, it tends to spring unexpected from novel connections, and novel connections, in turn, often go hand-in-hand with mess. That proved true when the Case Western Reserve University business school wanted a new marquee building for 2002. School decision makers found themselves drawn to architect Frank Gehry’s controversial but widely acclaimed style.</p><p>Designs such as the titanium-clad Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, and the Dr.-Seussish Ray and Maria Stata Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology blend swooping and jutting fun-house-mirror elements into imposing forms that imbue interior spaces with complex personalities and rarely fail to elicit emotional responses from observers. Case Western hoped for its own attention-grabbing design, and Gehry and his associates didn’t disappoint, ultimately unveiling a scale model of a building of wildly askew components seemingly caught in midexplosion, all of it wrapped and pierced by a river of writhing metal ribbon.</p><p>The school approved the design and brought in a small army of contractors to build it. The contractors duly admired, in a shocked and fretful way, the model of the God-awfully complex structure they were about to undertake, and then asked for the blueprints, to which Gehry’s team replied that there weren’t any. The contractors thought the group was joking, but Gehry and his associates assured the contractors they were serious. But constructing a building without blueprints, the stunned contractors might well have sputtered, would be like trying to put together a television set from scratch without a wiring diagram. Gehry’s group maintained that the contractors could derive the measurements they needed by studying the model of the building. The contractors rejoined that doing so wouldn’t result in a precisely scaled-up copy of the model—they’d have to work as much with impression as measurement. Exactly, said Gehry.</p><p>As it turns out, Gehry is concerned not with the precise angles or dimensions of a building, but with the emotional impression it instills in observers and inhabitants. The ability to convey this impression is elusive and fragile, he maintains, and can easily be lost in the neat, unambiguous precision of a two-dimensional drawing. Gehry partner Jim Glymph puts it this way: “When you break it into two-dimensional sections, everything can seem so close to the model. But when you put it all back together, you might lose a subtle curvature that you would think would make no difference—and without it the building is completely dead.”</p><p>To capture the building’s intended emotional content, Gehry maintains, everyone working on the building should keep creating throughout the construction process. Withholding blueprints is a way of making sure that happens. Forgoing a detailed plan is disruptive—it creates convolution, making a neat and well-defined process messy. It subverts the contractors’ familiar methods and procedures, forcing them to work with the Gehry team in the task of translating the look and feel of the model into a full-scale structure. Sure enough, the shocked Case Western contractors, fearing a disaster, staked out Gehry’s offices to try to determine how to proceed. “I had never, ever, spent more than an hour in an architect’s office prior to this job,” says Ed Sellers, chief operating officer at Cleveland-based GQ Contracting. “I made twenty-two trips on this job, spending four and five days at a time in their office. Because we didn’t have documents that completed the design, we found ourselves completing the design.”</p><p>Freed from the constraints of a blueprint’s rigid specifications and standard operating procedures, the contractors and architects were able to collaboratively rethink the design and construction techniques in any way necessary to achieve the project’s goals. That led to an eruption of innovation. GQ ultimately developed a new technique for framing curving interior walls with unconventional materials, a breakthrough that met the challenges of the Case Western building and later led to a highly profitable new line of business. Hunt Construction in Indianapolis created a new approach to surveying construction sites; Columbia Wire and Iron Works in Portland, Oregon, came up with a machine to double-bend steel beams; New York–based DeSimon Structural Engineers developed two new framing methods for structural steel; A. Zahner Company in Kansas City, Missouri, invented a new way to assemble metal panels. Not only was the finished building a stunning hit, completed on time and within budget, but most of the contractors were so pleased with the invention into which they had been pushed that they ended up changing the way they do business. Even in the highly conservative construction industry, not all surprises have to be nasty ones.</p><p class="ext1"><em>Invention:</em> Mess randomly juxtaposes and alters a system’s elements and rotates them to the fore where they’re more easily noticed, leading to new solutions. Neatness tends to limit novelty and the unexpected and sweeps them aside when they do occur.</p><p>Other examples of mess-driven invention:</p><p class="bl1">• Many celebrated chefs prefer to work amid a dense spread of ingredients and tools to facilitate their experimenting with new food combinations and techniques.</p><p class="bl3">• Distraction can help, too. Most of us have experienced the surprise thrill of coming up with a solution to a conundrum only after taking our minds off the problem.</p><p class="h1">Efficiency: A Messy Route to the Target</p><p class="p1">In the finger-pointing over U.S. setbacks and frustrations in the war on terror—be it the failure to prevent the 9/11 attacks, the inability to round up al-Qaeda’s chiefs, or the difficulties in reestablishing order in Iraq—most of the criticism has centered around a lack of sufficient organization on the part of U.S. government agencies and the military. There weren’t enough security procedures at airports; intelligence and law-enforcement agencies weren’t tightly coordinated; the military didn’t undertake enough planning for postwar Iraq; and so forth. But another way to look at the problem is to recognize that the terrorist enemies of the United States have been difficult to contend with because they are a mess. By leveraging their disorder, a relatively small number of terrorists, with few resources to draw on, have consistently confounded the most heavily equipped and highly ordered military and intelligence forces in history. Mess, in other words, has provided terrorists with efficiency.</p><p>Consider al-Qaeda. Its membership is scattered about the world, often mixed into the population. Its actions are unpredictable and inconsistent. Unlike traditional terrorist organizations, al-Qaeda isn’t neatly organized into cells or set groups of people who work together and coordinate with other cells. In fact, it may not even be appropriate to call al-Qaeda an organization at all; it has at times been referred to by experts as more of a movement or even a philosophy. It springs up here and disappears there, constantly pulling in new members. Because its adherents don’t bother to emplace hierarchy, standards, or even much communication, it tends to do governments little good to capture a few of them. Al-Qaeda members typically lack knowledge about the existence of other members, let alone what they’re up to, and have no means to contact them. Al-Qaeda has no single enemy or set of targets and no single plan of attack, so no country can be sure if it is likely to be hit, or if so, when or how. All this has made al-Qaeda a nightmare for experts who simply wish to know what they’re up against. “Since so little about al-Qaeda’s organization is fixed, counterterrorism analysts and strategists have to be ready to adapt their views to shifting realities and prospects,” notes David Ronfeldt, a senior social scientist at national-security think tank Rand Corporation. Much the same is true of the insurgency in Iraq.</p><p>As effective as disorder has been for terrorists, the highly ordered approach to defense by the United States has often proved unproductive or worse. The military can dispatch tightly coordinated battalions of soldiers equipped with state-of-the-art weapons, and patrol the skies with missile-equipped drones, but whom do they fire at? Tens of thousands of analysts pore over wiretap transcripts, airline passenger lists, and financial records, but few trails materialize. Meanwhile, a convoy of army trucks is a sitting duck for so-called improvised explosive devices, and even the Pentagon—the very building that houses many of those analysts—becomes a reachable target. A report from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, found that existing counterterrorism efforts “show no evidence of reducing terrorism and may even increase the likelihood of terrorism and terrorism-related harm.” <em>The 9/11 Commission Report</em> echoes that sentiment in sections, suggesting that U.S. interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan may well ultimately have the effect of turning those countries into “breeding grounds for attacks against Americans at home.” And yet the focus of new U.S. antiterrorism efforts tends to be on establishing ever-higher levels of order. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Agency are undergoing near-constant reorganization, and the U.S. military is spending some $100 billion on the Future Combat Systems project, focused on setting up sensor networks and communication links for better command and control.</p><p>It’s true, the United States itself isn’t in a position to become highly messy in its battle against terrorism. The nation can’t disperse its military to hide among the population or dismantle the ordered infrastructure of civilian life that presents so many vulnerable targets. Nor can it drop the commitment to democracy and humane behavior that prevents running roughshod over vast numbers of innocent civilians in order to get at a small number of terrorists. But merely recognizing that the enemy’s disorder is its greatest strength—rather than obsessing over an imagined lack of order on the part of the United States—might go a long way to suggesting some new strategies.</p><p class="p3">For example, some experts have recommended trying to pass on bewildering amounts of false information to known terrorists rather than capturing and interrogating them; because the terrorist networks are so loose, there would be no good way for the terrorists to stop it or even monitor its flow. Others have advocated focusing on midlevel terrorists rather than terrorist leaders, because studies show that in a disordered network it is often the nodes in the middle that carry the greatest workload and whose sudden absence is most disruptive. Instead of concentrating on efforts to painstakingly filter and analyze the millions of pieces of near-random information that intelligence agencies gather about everything from air travel to bank deposits—the FBI alone has already scrapped three different computer systems that have failed to prove useful in its antiterrorism efforts—the intelligence and law enforcement communities could turn to computer programs designed to continually pore over vast, unrelated streams of data to pull out possible connections. And rather than trying to prevent every possible attack, the United States could do a better job of preparing its troops and civilians to survive attacks. Thicker armor on vehicles and torsos can sometimes do a lot more good than networks of sensors. Likewise, high-tech security expert Bruce Schneier has pointed out that the only effective antiterrorism security features that have emerged for air travel have been stronger cockpit doors and passengers more prepared to fight back. Mess isn’t an invincible weapon, but it’s one that needs to be appreciated to be countered.</p><p class="ext4"><em>Efficiency:</em> Messy systems often accomplish goals with a modest consumption of resources and can sometimes shift some of the burden of work to the outside world. Being neat requires a constant expenditure of resources and tends to leave the burden of work trapped in the system.</p><p>Other examples of how mess can produce efficiency:</p><p class="bl1">• The leader of a search-and-rescue operation must sometimes consider whether it will be more effective to organize a careful, methodical search or to simply scatter whatever people are at hand to begin searching immediately and even frantically. The latter approach can be especially appropriate when seconds count, as in the abduction of a child or when someone is missing in the water by a beach.</p><p class="bl3">• Inconsistency often pays off for competitive runners, many of whom achieve maximum aerobic efficiency by adopting a highly varied conditioning regimen, continually altering the speed, length, difficulty, and frequency of their running routines.</p><p class="h1">Robustness: Well-Rounded Strength</p><p class="p1">Messiness is often taken as a sign of weakness. In a person, it’s regarded as a character flaw. And most companies would be quick to assume that the less tightly organized a competitor is, the more vulnerable it is. But in fact, disorder can confer certain kinds of strength—a phenomenon that a private early-childhood school called the Little Red Wagon has used to its advantage. Not that you’d see any disorder if you walked into the school on opening day. What you’d be likely to notice is that the walls of the two large classrooms are almost entirely bare. It’s a strangely disconcerting sight, one that might lead a visiting parent to infer a poverty of imagination or energy on the teachers’ parts and fear for the level of stimulation and good cheer in the classrooms. But Gail Leftin, the founder and director of the school, is used to addressing such anxieties. “When you put up a poster with the alphabet, you’re telling the children several things,” she says. “That they’re supposed to learn the letters. That they’re supposed to learn them in this order. That the apple in ‘A is for Apple’ is a <em>red</em> apple, so that I guess apples are supposed to be red. But what you’re not telling them is ‘<em>why.</em>’ Why do they have to learn the ABCs? Why should they color apples red?”</p><p>It’s not that children shouldn’t learn and do these things, she explains. Leftin questions whether they should learn it just because a piece of paper on a wall or even a teacher says so. “When children learn from a poster, or from a teacher’s lesson, then what they’re really learning is how to follow directions and remember facts that are handed to them,” she says. The overriding operating principle of the Little Red Wagon, as it turns out, is to provide as little prepackaged learning to the children as possible. There is no set curriculum. There are no carefully planned-out projects. There is no prewritten play that they will put on for parents. The children will develop it all themselves as they go along in a sort of festival of creative mess.</p><p>The basic idea at the Little Red Wagon is that groups of children are provided with a variety of simple materials—Leftin keeps basketfuls of corks, clay, colored sand, and feathers on hand, as well as conventional toys like dolls, cars, and blocks—and little direction in terms of what to do with them. Sometimes a teacher will read the group a story to suggest a particular theme, such as the jungle, space travel, or dinosaurs, though no effort is made to get the children to adhere to the theme when the story is over. When they start playing, the teacher sits with them and observes, sometimes asking a child to explain what she is doing, answering questions, providing crafts-related technical help (such as suggesting a way to fix a piece of yarn to a cork), taking notes about what the children are doing and saying, and occasionally taking a snapshot with a digital camera.</p><p>The teachers are usually surprised by what the children do. Still, as each child sees what the others are up to, the projects usually end up converging on a loose theme. A group that was gluing circles on paper, for example, started to focus on eyeglasses, which led to an exploration of seeing, and finally centered on how the body works. One boy started pounding on a doll with a block; instead of admonishing him, a teacher expressed interest, and the boy explained he needed an injured patient on which to practice medicine. Soon half the class was involved in running a hospital.</p><p>Although the Little Red Wagon teachers don’t “teach” in a conventional sense, neither are they passive observers. They’re trained to look for opportunities to interject questions that might naturally lead to learning of numbers and phonics and other standard concepts. When a teacher points out that a child has three squares in her picture, she is prompting the group to think about counting. When two children finish building a tower together, a teacher might suggest they help her write a “Please don’t touch” label to preserve it. Because this sort of learning is attached to material that the children have gravitated to on their own, they tend to be more interested in it and understand it in a useful context. They’re more likely to remember lessons imparted this way, too; it’s like the difference between trying to memorize the driving directions someone dictates to you and having a route burned into your brain by finding it on your own.</p><p>Leftin notes that in conventional schools teachers have to waste much of their time and energy on getting students to focus on the rigidly structured activity or lesson. She tells the story of being invited to speak about her program to teachers and administrators at a larger school. When one teacher asked how Little Red Wagon’s teachers deal with discipline problems, Leftin told the stunned group that she couldn’t answer the question, because her school had never had one. Discipline problems typically arise when children become bored or frustrated, as often happens with preplanned lessons or activities. At Leftin’s school, every child is always interested in what he is doing, because he chooses to do it. That leaves the teachers free to help the children get the most out of their activities, instead of having to keep them in line.</p><p>As for the blank walls, they quickly become filled with the children’s work and with snapshots of individual children in midproject, captioned with quotes from the teachers’ notes. “The walls become a way of documenting the learning journey for kids and parents,” says Leftin. “The walls are our curriculum. We just don’t know what it is until they’re filled.”</p><p>The Little Red Wagon’s disordered, curriculumless approach seems especially risky at a time when states have rushed into standardized testing for elementary school students, leading to more sharply defined, rigid curricula as early as kindergarten. But Leftin has tracked Little Red Wagon graduates and found they generally score well above average on standardized testing in early grade school. Still, the real advantage to the Little Red Wagon approach, she says, is the creativity, confidence, and boldness that it imparts—the school’s messy approach to education instills an intellectual robustness that holds up in any classroom or testing situation. Children who are exposed to more focused curricula specifically geared toward testing, in contrast, often have difficulties with creative exercises and even with any new curriculum. “The children here feel very rewarded for experimenting and creating,” she says. “That stays with them and helps them when they encounter rigid curricula later on.”</p><p class="p3">Parents seem to agree. While most private early-childhood schools in the area have had to market aggressively, Leftin now fills her school to its capacity almost entirely through word of mouth and ends up having to turn away students. As the Little Red Wagon’s reputation has grown, more schools have approached Leftin with requests to explain her techniques. Everyone seems to agree that our schools need improving, but not many people would have thought that mess was a missing ingredient.</p><p class="ext4"><em>Robustness:</em> Because mess tends to loosely weave together disparate elements, messy systems are more resistant to destruction, failure, and imitation. Neat systems tend to have more sharply defined strong and weak points, and thus are often brittle, easily foiled or disrupted, and easily copied.</p><p>A few more examples:</p><p class="bl1">• Mixture can lead to robustness—as for example with mutts, who tend to be hardier than purebred dogs thanks to the random interweaving of less-similar genes from unlike parents.</p><p class="bl">• Noise can produce robustness, too. Conventional computer chips generate errors when faced with noise in the form of high levels of random electron motion in their circuits, but new quantum computers now in the works won’t just tolerate noise at the atomic level, they’ll directly employ it to solve problems millions of times faster.</p><p class="bl3">• Navy SEALs rely on improvisation rather than orders to achieve the sort of mission robustness that can keep them out of enemy hands during dangerous infiltrations, leaving them ready to adapt to unpredictable, complex, and fast-changing situations.</p><p class="spb">Now that we’ve seen a few examples of how mess and disorder can work in a person’s or organization’s favor, we’re ready to zoom in for a closer look at the different ways people relate to mess.</p></div></body></html>
