Even visitors from most other big U.S. cities—people, in other words, who know a thing or two about hustle and bustle—end up aghast at the willingness of Manhattanite pedestrians to charge through vehicular gauntlets in blatant disregard of traffic signals and crosswalks. New York mayors Giuliani and Bloomberg each cracked down in turn on the city’s jaywalking culture, assailing it variously as dangerous, disruptive to the carefully regulated flow of traffic, and even a form of petty crime that contributes to a general sense of lawlessness.</p><p>Whether jaywalking leads to muggings or drug abuse is a question beyond the scope of this book. But do jaywalkers thwart the efficiency of neatly timed pedestrian and traffic signals? If that were the case, then the most pedestrian-heavy sections of Washington, DC, Tokyo, London, and other cities where there is relatively little jaywalking should be models of people-movement efficiency compared to New York. But they aren’t. As pedestrians in these cities congregate on corners waiting faithfully for a WALK signal, they form a large crowd. The crowd crosses together when it gets the signal and tends to remain together as it oozes down the block, a pig in a python limited by the speed of the slowest pedestrians in the group. When the crowd reaches the next intersection, it swells further. These waxing clots of pedestrians can clash with one another, block sidewalks, and even grow large enough to create a pedestrian-vehicular gridlock.</p><p>The crowds move more smoothly in Manhattan, thanks to the fact that jaywalkers thin them out by acting as a sort of relief valve. That’s not to say that an increased disregard for traffic signals is always an improvement—traffic flow in Mexico City and Bangkok, for example, is chronically hobbled by an overabundance of jaywalkers. But blending a measure of jaywalking into a mostly orderly system of signal-regulated flow works fairly well.</p><p class="p3">A modest level of messy walking may not only get the crowds through the city faster, it probably saves lives. Though statistics on this point are hard to sort out, a search of newspaper accident reports seems to support the notion that in the United States pedestrians are more likely to be struck by cars while in crosswalks than when outside of them (assuming there’s a crosswalk in the area). This makes perfect sense, even if it seems unjust. Crosswalks are typically at intersections, where vehicular traffic is converging and often turning from four or more directions. Pedestrians who are legally in the crosswalks often stare straight ahead as they walk—the sign has told them to proceed, so they assume they must be safe. But if pedestrian signals carried small print, they might reasonably read, WALK*</p><p class="ext1">*very carefully, keeping a close eye out for drivers on the cross street who have a green light and may be hurtling around the corner, not to mention distracted, drug-or-alcohol-addled, and sociopathic drivers who aren’t prepared to give way even to legal crossers</p><p class="spb">Jaywalkers, on the other hand, generally don’t need to be told to watch carefully and move nimbly. They also usually don’t have to worry about traffic coming from more than one direction at a time, because they’re either crossing midblock, away from intersections, or at intersections while the DON’T WALK signals are glowing, which means cars on the cross streets are stopped at red lights rather than turning into surprised crosswalkers. Perhaps all this is why police in New York City, as well as in Boston, where legend has it the term <em>jaywalking</em> originated (<em>jay</em> being slang at one time for a hick), rarely hand out jaywalking tickets. Be warned, though. In Singapore, jaywalking can get you six months in jail.</p><p class="h1">Analyzing Mess’s Pros and Cons</p><p class="p1">Whether in business, at home, or in navigating New York’s streets, messier isn’t always better—it’s all about achieving the <em>optimal</em> level of messiness. People and organizations tend to be biased toward excess neatness and order, which is why this book has been pushing messiness. But people and organizations aren’t usually at their best when they’re highly messy in all ways or highly neat in all ways.</p><p>There are plenty of exceptions. Pharmacies and ATM machines aren’t likely to thrive on mess. Mosh pits and demolition derbies, on the other hand, might suffer from even a little order. But more often, people and organizations are at their best when they’ve achieved an interesting mix of messiness and order. In this sense, mess and disorder can be variables to be played around with, placing you on a frontier for experiment, rather than on a treadmill for rotely increasing neatness and organization. The formula for experimenting with mess is simple enough and works in personal, institutional, and technical contexts: Try being a little messier in some way, and see if there’s an improvement. If there is, try a little more. Keep going until you get the sense that somewhere along the way things got worse, at which point you might want to try being a little neater. You get the idea.</p><p>The reason there are optimal levels of mess is simple, from a theoretical viewpoint. As you increase the messiness of a system in some way, you’ll obtain certain benefits (in such forms as flexibility, serendipitous connections, and savings in the cost of neatness) and suffer some drawbacks (typically in conventional inefficiencies). Take, for example, that old favorite, the messy desk. As a desk becomes a little messy, more documents and other items may end up usefully at hand in sensible piles with few disadvantages, instead of filed away and forgotten. As the desk becomes messier, more items may be usefully at hand, but now it may also become harder to locate others. By the time the desk becomes buried under a single massive mound, the situation has presumably become dysfunctional.</p><p>The advantages and disadvantages to increasing mess don’t kick in smoothly and steadily. With most systems, adding a little mess tends to lead quickly to some big advantages with few drawbacks. As the mess grows, the rate at which the advantages grow tends to slow and eventually trail off—a desk that’s already pretty messy doesn’t become a lot more useful when you add a bit more mess to it. Meanwhile, the rate at which the disadvantages accumulate will eventually start to take off—a very messy desk with just a small amount of open workspace can dramatically leap into utter uselessness when a little additional mess takes over that space. The result is that as mess is added to a system, the disadvantages will at some point start to overwhelm the advantages. That’s why, for example, a little jaywalking can be a good thing, and ubiquitous jaywalking can be a big problem.</p><p>Remember, too, that mess levels can often be varied in multiple dimensions. In some cases, the mess levels can be experimented with independently—so that, for example, you could neaten up your office a bit without messing up your tightly scheduled day. In other cases, changing the mess level in one dimension will force changes in another—as when, for example, you start scheduling your day more tightly and realize you no longer seem to have quite enough time to maintain an immaculate personal appearance. In fact, a formal analysis of any system’s multidimensionally optimized mess levels would be a formidable task. Suffice it to say, you’re better off just playing around with mess and seeing what happens.</p><p class="h1">When Buses Fly</p><p class="p1">Ed Iacobucci often had to travel several times a week as CEO of Citrix Systems, the $750-million computer-server-software company he founded in 1989. In doing so, Iacobucci was regularly irked by the fact that business travelers who fly between smaller cities waste a lot of time making connections at one or more “hub” airports that serve bigger cities. It wasn’t just a slight inconvenience; the lost time turned what otherwise might have been a day trip into an overnighter. Why couldn’t airlines fly people directly between small cities, so they could get back home to their families by evening?</p><p>Three reasons, as it turns out. One is that on any given morning, there’s likely to be at best only a handful of people who want to fly between any two small cities—barely enough to fill a tiny, slow, inefficient, weather-sensitive propeller plane. Second, traffic between most pairs of small cities wouldn’t be steady or predictable enough to support a tiny plane’s worth of regular routes and schedules—there might be four people one day and none the next. And finally, how would an inter-small-city airline set fares, given the likely variation in day-to-day traffic? A fare that would be profitable with four passengers could be a big money-loser with just two fewer passengers. One could always charter a small jet for the trip, of course, at a typical cost of about $5,000 or more for a journey across a couple of states, but that was hardly a universal solution to the problem.</p><p>Pondering these obstacles led Iacobucci to pose another question: could an airline operate with routes and schedules that changed day to day? Free of fixed routes and scheduling, planes could be dispatched in response to the constant and messy ebb and flow of customer demand. The trick would be to find a way to do it not as a pricey charter or “air taxi” service, whose aircraft are each booked for the needs of a single party, but as a genuine airline whose aircraft carried groups of independent passengers.</p><p>To answer that last question, let’s start with another: would you rather be served by a bus that runs relatively infrequently but is always exactly on schedule, or one that runs more frequently but is sometimes five or so minutes late? Bus riders generally say that timeliness is the most important aspect of service. But timeliness is a surprisingly complex issue. When a bus repeatedly arrives late at its stops, transit departments usually simply schedule a later arrival time for the bus, which translates to slower, less frequent service. But it turns out that riders don’t mind lateness much if they’re warned about it. One study in London—a city of inveterate bus riders—found that people rated their level of satisfaction with bus service twice as highly when they were told about impending late bus arrivals. “The big question for many riders is this: ‘Do I have enough time to run to Starbucks?’” says Matthew Rabkin, a research analyst for the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, a transit think tank in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For that reason, a growing number of bus transit systems are tracking buses’ locations via global positioning system (GPS) transmitters, and transmitting arrival predictions to electronic bus-stop signs, Web sites, and even cell phones. Alleviating riders’ frustration with late buses then frees up planners to schedule more frequent, if messier, service.</p><p>Why, indeed, should buses run on regular schedules at all? Thanks to the transit “smart cards” with which many riders pay, as well as to onboard sensors that can track how many people get on and off a bus, the schedule for a route can be varied day to day or even, in theory, over the course of an hour as ridership climbs and falls. Buses on routes with unexpectedly low ridership can be diverted on short notice to routes that can better use them. For that matter, why should buses always be confined to their precise routes? Buses aren’t stuck running on tracks. In Maryland’s traffic-clogged Montgomery County outside of Washington, DC, GPS-equipped buses are monitored in a NASA-style control room by operators who can direct bus drivers off their routes to get around traffic jams, and even ease their way by remotely triggering green traffic lights for them. (Who says traffic lights have to be on a rigid schedule?)</p><p>Come to think of it, why have fixed routes in the first place? With GPS systems, onboard computer displays, and control centers equipped with space-age route configuration software, transit systems could constantly reconfigure bus paths to get closer to the positions of those people who actually want a ride at any particular time. In eastern Prince William County and the Manassas area in Virginia, anyone can phone in and request an “off-route” pickup from certain buses. Off-route drop-off points can likewise be requested. Other areas that offer some degree of flexible routing include Madison, Wisconsin, Salt Lake City, and suburban Detroit, and many others are looking closely at it.</p><p>Thus, the bus world offered a sort of precedent for Iacobucci. But translating the concept of flexible routes and scheduling to an airline is tricky. A big airline typically offers about fifty routes to serve some thirty cities, but it would take some sixteen million routes to provide direct flights between every possible pair of about the same number of cities, never mind the hundreds of cities a flexible-route, small-city airline would have to service—and all while filing and sticking to flight plans, getting matched up with crews, and following meticulous, heavily regulated maintenance schedules. In addition, intercity business travelers need reliable reservations, not just a strong hope that a plane will be available on the morning they need it. As for setting fares, that’s not an issue with buses, where the cost per rider is often pocket change. Flying, in contrast, is relatively expensive, and the price of a ticket would have to be at least in the ballpark of regular airline tickets, while reflecting potentially wild variation among passenger loads.</p><p>At first, a small-city airline service seemed a lost cause to Iacobucci. But when he left Citrix in 2000, he found himself thinking he might be able to pull it off. For one thing, a company called Eclipse Aviation in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was working on a new class of six-seat aircraft called a <em>microjet,</em> which would carry six people with nearly the speed, efficiency, comfort, and weather-insensitivity of a big jet. Meanwhile, computer technology had advanced to the point where, Iacobucci believed, the massive mixing-and-matching chores required to figure out where to send each plane each day could be crunched out quickly and affordably enough.</p><p>Most important, Iacobucci dreamed up a business plan that added a measure of order to the messiness of flexible-schedule-and-route flying. “DayJet,” as Iacobucci has named his airline, will let customers specify which cities they want to fly between on what days, at which point DayJet will figure out the routes it will need to fly to most efficiently serve the greatest number of customers on a given day, and what prices it needs to charge each passenger to make a profit. Bear in mind that the big airlines tear their hair out simply over having to figure out their optimal fixed routes every few months. DayJet’s computers will work it out hour by hour, with countless times as many possible routes.</p><p>Critically, DayJet won’t merely be figuring out a single, set price for a flight—it will offer each customer a menu of two or more prices based on how flexible the customer can be with regard to departure time. Basically, travelers will get a discount for giving DayJet a little wiggle room on timing, because that will increase the chances that DayJet can fit them in a plane with other passengers who want the same route on that day, dramatically lowering the airline’s per-passenger costs. In this way, DayJet will essentially rejigger its scheduling and prices every time the phone rings. “We keep everything suspended as long as possible in a state of flux and disruption,” says Iacobucci. “We don’t freeze the schedule until the last possible moment.” It’s a form of order that will continually be messed up and then reordered. Iacobucci calculates as an example that DayJet will be able to fly passengers from Montgomery, Alabama, to Danville, Virginia, in two and a half hours for about $600, compared to five hours and $350 on a cheap commercial flight with a plane change, and $4,000 for a one-and-a-half-hour charter-jet ride.</p><p>It’s something to think about while you kill time in Chicago waiting for your connecting flight to Appleton, Wisconsin.</p><p class="h1">Search Us</p><p class="p1">A mess can be rewarding as the object of random browsing, as for example at a flea market, through a stack of Sunday newspaper flyers, among the boxes of a departed loved one’s mementos and documents, or at a café well situated for people-watching on a busy street. The Web is a giant mess, too. Aside from a few notable exceptions, such as Web censorship in China and the prosecution of Web gambling promoters and pornographers in the United States, anyone can put up any sort of Web site they want. There is no inherent unifying or overarching structure to the aggregate content, other than the technical rules followed in making the content displayable and the Web site reachable through an address.</p><p>But the sort of roam-and-scan browsing that works well in a flea market isn’t really an option with the Web. There’s no easily accessible list of all Web sites to browse through, and even if there were it’s hard to imagine how a list of more than eight billion Web pages could be arranged to allow your eye to be caught by the pages likely to hold interest. Eight billion, if you’re wondering, is the number of Web pages Google claims to <em>index</em>—that is, sort through to allow searching for text. By enabling you to hunt down Web sites containing certain words, Google and other search engines impose a form of order on the Web that makes fantastically useful what would otherwise be paralyzingly cluttered and inaccessible.</p><p>Google’s impact is moving beyond Web text searches as it throws itself into shopping, maps, books, and images. It could even spill into the physical world, as the growing availability of tiny, dirt-cheap chips with built-in radio transmitters is expected to create an opportunity for Google to let people call up the exact location of their car keys or their children. Imagine being able to simply toss things into your attic without any concern for any form of organization, and then going to Google when you needed one of the items to call up its position within the attic. In short, Google is a wonderful way to get your hands on a specific piece of information out of a vast trove that no one has to waste time putting in order.</p><p>Googling has become such a routine, comfortable, and seemingly effective part of everyday life, that it’s easy to overlook its drawbacks. One of them is what Bret Rappaport calls “the shade-tree problem.” (Rappaport, as you may recall, is the natural-landscape-championing lawyer from chapter 2; he tends to put things in floratic terms.) Imagine, he says, a paralegal in a law firm asked to research case law relating to a Texas client’s ire with a neighbor whose tree has grown to overhang the client’s lawn, preventing part of the lawn from getting enough sun to survive. The paralegal would likely run to Lexis—the legal world’s version of Google—and enter in the keywords <em>tree, lawn, neighbor,</em> and <em>shade.</em> A few cases pop up and are dutifully handed over, wrapping up the chore in five minutes. But thirty years ago, says Rappaport, the paralegal would have hit the Texas law books, running her finger over topic listings and indexes, perhaps intending to look up <em>trees,</em> but noticing there are also sublistings for tree houses, oaks, and bushes. In leafing through the book to check out some of the indicated cases, other cases leap out as interesting and possibly relevant. Perhaps it takes half an hour, but in the end the paralegal uncovers what turns out to be the most useful case in the books, one in which a vine invaded a neighbor’s swimming pool, and in which the words <em>tree</em> and <em>lawn</em> never appear. What’s more, this more prolonged and varied hunt has imbued the paralegal with a bit of perspective and even expertise in the subject that could come in handy in this case or another one. Over time and many such hunts, the expertise will extend to a range of topics. In other words, the very imprecision and inefficiencies of the conventional search process compared to Googling provides better results and a measure of enrichment, if at a cost in time.</p><p>A number of search engines have tried to get around the flaws in Google-style exact-match searching. Clusty.com is one of many that use “clustering,” a technique that returns not just Web pages that match your exact queries, but also other search categories that might be fruitful. Thus, a search on <em>hot dog,</em> for example, yields a suggestion to look at Web pages related to sausages, Coney Island, and recipes—the sorts of categories that you might run across if you were browsing through a directory for <em>hot dog.</em> A company called Fast offers different search engines—some based on technology developed to help the U.S. military hunt down information useful in combating terrorism—that can derive a certain amount of meaning and context from the text it scans. That might allow it, for example, to distinguish sites that label certain movies as “bombs” from sites that offer recipes for homemade bombs, and to throw in sites that include the word <em>explosive</em> but don’t mention the word <em>bomb.</em> A firm called Cymfony provides a search service that scours blogs as well as the Web to track down information with a particular subjective content—for example, in searching out references to a company, it can distinguish those that praise the company from those that flame it.</p><p>There are also innumerable search engines that specialize in a subset of the Web or in searching specific non-Web databases, and these engines often prompt searchers to dig deeper by enlisting specific criteria. A prominent example is Amazon.com’s book-searching engine, which allows one to search its catalog with an eye for, say, Spanish-language books on ghosts published in 2003. (You can then follow up by checking each book’s Amazon listing to see which offers the most words per pound.) A number of companies are working to make video searchable. IBM, for one, struck a deal with the NFL in 2005 to do so with all NFL game films, allowing a coach to call up in five seconds, for example, all of an upcoming opponent’s third-down plays with four yards to go for a first down—the sort of task that had previously taken six hours. And then there’s the search engine BananaSlug, which adds a random search term, such as <em>coral,</em> or <em>justice,</em> to your specified search terms. Strange as it sounds, you simply have to try it to appreciate its utility.</p><p>Some of these techniques work by trying to impose more order on the search process than Googling does and some less. One manager at the search company Fast routinely draws on a portfolio of thirty different search engines to track down information. In the end, there probably will never be one search technique, or one particular level of order, that will always prove appropriate or sufficient for dealing with a giant mess, especially one as gigantic as the Web. And somehow, that seems fitting.</p><p class="h1">Electronic Chips to Poker Chips</p><p class="p1"><strong>Changeable versus Cheap Chips</strong> Products that contain electronic chips usually use one of two basic types: hardwired chips, in which custom circuitry is engraved onto the chip, or programmable chips, which provide a range of standard building-block circuits that can be assembled by a software program—though not in an efficient way—into circuitry that performs the product tasks. The trade-offs are straightforward. Hardwired chips can cost $10 million, take years for design and manufacturing tooling, and can’t easily be changed later on—but because they’re so fixed and highly ordered, they’re extremely fast, and once the up-front work is done they cost as little as pennies each to produce. Programmable chips, on the other hand, require little up-front investment and are easily designed and modified, but the drawback to all that messy flexibility is that they can cost $100 or more each to make and are typically tens of times slower than custom chips. But why choose? Increasingly, companies are turning to chips that combine a certain amount of custom, hardwired circuitry with a modest level of changeability. These semicustom, semimessy chips allow them to bring fairly high-performance products to market more quickly without prohibitive costs, either up-front or per-unit. <em>Purchasing</em> magazine predicts that by 2008 the market for semicustom chips will jump tenfold from its 2003 level to $1.4 billion.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Tender Smackdowns</strong> The various incarnations of cage, or no-holds-barred, fighting—in which two opponents have at each other with few rules, usually in a fenced-in ring, until one of them is twisted or pummeled into submission—have been widely perceived as gory, vicious, sadistic, and extremely dangerous events featuring brutal psychopaths. Famously branded a “human cockfight” by Senator John McCain, the sport has been the subject of frequent outraged magazine and television news pieces, and thanks in part to McCain has been outlawed in all but one state at one time or another. But the notion that cage fighting is more dangerous and brutal than boxing, a widely admired sport that is routinely and cheerfully covered by the same networks and publications that cluck at cage fighting, would have to come as news to the family and friends of Leavander Johnson, a lightweight champion boxer who died after a fight in September 2005—the second boxer to be killed in a boxing match that year and the fourth to suffer serious brain damage. Over the years, some twelve hundred boxers have died from injuries sustained in the ring. The toll for the entire history of no-holds-barred fighting: the death in the Ukraine of an American fighter in his first bout, who hadn’t been allowed to fight in the United States because he had been known to suffer from blackouts during training and who succumbed after four blows to the head. To be sure, there have been far more boxing matches than cage fights, making statistical comparisons difficult. But there’s good reason why boxing should prove more dangerous on a fight-by-fight basis. Cage fighting may be messier than boxing in most ways, with its elbow strikes, kicks, and choke holds, and especially because of the frequency with which blood is drawn and then splattered by blows to the head—often to an opponent on his back—from fists covered with just thinly padded half-gloves. Boxing, in contrast, is relatively neat, featuring stand-up punching only, with heavily padded gloves. But here’s the catch: boxing’s repeated punching to the head wreaks havoc on the brain. The heavily padded gloves do a great job of minimizing gashes, ensuring longer fights that won’t be stopped because of superficial bleeding, and allowing more opportunities to land blows to the head that drive the brain against the skull. (A knockout is a mild form of brain damage, one from which the brain may never entirely recover.) Middle-aged former boxers often speak with slurred words and with other difficulties or are palsied, because the mess in boxing is all inside the head, where the body is most vulnerable and least able to heal itself. The editors of the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> have stated that 75 percent of boxers with twenty or more professional bouts are observably brain damaged. No cage fighters, in contrast, have been diagnosed with severe or chronic brain damage. Perhaps if all this were better known, no-holds-barred fighting might win over more boxing fans like Senator McCain, who reportedly was ringside in Las Vegas in 1995 to watch the boxer Jimmy Garcia receive fatal brain injuries.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Shake That Thing</strong> Pilots, like automobile drivers, want aircraft that handle predictably and provide precise control. Jet manufacturers have obliged over the years, producing control systems, often computer assisted, that make planes respond smoothly to the pilot’s every input through the control yoke. Actually, they initially did <em>too</em> good a job of it. When an airplane moves too slowly, it risks losing its lift and plunging. One of the traditional tip-offs to this potentially calamitous loss of lift is a yoke that shakes, a sure sign that something serious is amiss, but in higher-tech planes there’s no such inherent yoke “feel” to the impending drop. Planes often have warning horns, lights, and even computer voices to signal a dangerous loss in speed, but when a pilot has let a plane get too slow it’s often because some other sort of emergency is stealing his attention—a cockpit fire, for example, or a close brush with another plane—and one more warning sound or light can go unnoticed. So manufacturers have now put back in a little of the erratic behavior they had taken out, in the form of a mechanism that causes the yoke to shake when the plane is about to lose its lift. This added mess plugs a problematic hole in an otherwise beneficial neatening.</p><p class="spb"><strong>The Silicon Mouse</strong> Cornell researcher Michael Shuler realized that a big reason drug effects are hard to predict is that when a drug is taken it’s whirled on a wild, high-pressure ride through the body, where it can be broken down by the liver, absorbed by the intestines, and held on to by fat. Testing drugs on cells in a test tube is too neat, leaving out most of the chemical interactions that take place on the true ride. Testing them on animals and people is too messy, because there are too many interactions with hard-to-observe organs to get a clear picture. That’s why, after a typical ten years and $800 million of this sort of research per approved drug, we still end up with Vioxx and many other drugs that get pulled off the market for unforeseen side effects—and no one knows how many hundreds of potentially terrific drugs never see the inside of a pill bottle because of flawed testing. Shuler and fellow researcher Greg Baxter came up with a compromise: a silicon chip that looks like an electronic one, except carved with shallow chambers and snaking channels lined with living human or animal tissue, through which artificial blood and a test drug is pumped. The chip mimics many of the messy effects of organs while preserving a neat, observable means for seeing what’s going on. Pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson has already signed on to put the chip through its paces, and some experts predict it could lop $100 million off the cost of testing a drug, not to mention eliminating the deaths of millions of lab animals each year.</p><p class="spb"><strong>The Other World Series</strong> Poker has become hugely popular in recent years, with more and more Americans pouring leisure time into honing their talents at the table. But how much does skill matter? Luck—that is, randomness—seems to play the larger role, at least to judge by the fact that no player has won the World Series of Poker main event more than once since the 1980s, when only dozens of players competed. Indeed, only two players have managed repeat appearances in the final round of nine players since the number of competitors hit five hundred in 2000. Perhaps as a result, some enterprising individuals—inspired in large part by a desire to operate poker Web sites legitimately in the United States, where online gambling is illegal—came up with a truly skill-only, no-luck version of the game. No-luck poker is set up like tournament bridge, in that the players at one of the multiple tables (real or virtual) are given the same hands as the players at other tables. Each player is then evaluated not against the other players at the table—who after all have different cards—but against her counterpart with the same hand at a different table. The game emerged in 2003, and since then has gone pretty much nowhere. The original Poker.com, a company that dedicated itself to marketing the most prominent incarnation of the game, ran out of money in 2004. (The current owner of the Poker.com Web site does not offer no-luck poker.) <em>News flash:</em> people <em>like</em> the fact that poker is a combination of skill and randomness. Those who want to keep luck out of it can play chess or, well, tournament bridge. Those who want to keep skill out of it can play roulette.</p></div></body></html>
