<p class="normal">Imre Lakatos is one of the most important philosophers of science of the twentieth century. His approach to scientific methodology was very influential, and the contribution he made to the philosophy of mathematics is, according to Ian Hacking, “to put it simply, definitive: the subject will never be the same again” (Hacking 2000, 28). It took Lakatos only eight years after receiving his Ph.D. at Cambridge to ascend to the prestigious philosophy chair at the London School of Economics in 1969, after Karl Popper’s retirement. Currently, the greatest recognition in the philosophy of science bears his name: the Lakatos Award.</p>

<p class="normal">On the Lakatos Award page on the London School of Economics’ website, one could until recently click on a link and get access to Lakatos’s short biography. The link is still there but the file is no longer accessible.

<p class="bodytext-bs">Here are the key parts:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Born in Debrecen in eastern Hungary in 1922, he graduated . . . from Debrecen University in 1944. He then joined the underground resistance against the Nazi invasion of Hungary. . . . After the War he was active in the Communist Party and played a highly influential role in the Ministry of Education in Hungary’s key period of radical educational reform for universal access to Higher Education on the basis of merit. . . . [I]n 1950 he was arrested and spent the next three years as a political prisoner in Recsk labour camp without legal trial.</p>
<p class="bodytext-ts">Although there is some truth in these passages, they are mixed with distortions and misleading implications to such a degree that the reader is bound to be led astray. I will mention three points.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_109" title="109"></span>First, the claim that Lakatos “joined the underground resistance against the Nazi invasion of Hungary” sounds as if he was engaged in fighting against the German occupation. But this is simply not true. As we can read in one of the main sources about Lakatos’s life in Hungary, he in fact <i>firmly rejected</i> a suggestion that members of his secret seminars should engage in anti-fascist resistance (Long 2002, 265).</p>
<p class="bodytext">The preprint of Jancis Long’s article “The Unforgiven: Imre Lakatos’ Life in Hungary” was circulating among philosophers when I was at Kings College London in 1999–2000 and it was widely discussed then. It is odd that now, almost fifteen years after the article was published, the myth about Lakatos’s brave (armed?) resistance against the Nazis is still being propagated. See the most widely used introduction to the philosophy of science, Peter Godfrey-Smith’s <i>Theory and Reality</i> (2009, 103); an article by Ian Hacking (2000); and recent announcements about Lakatos Award recipients: e.g., <a href="http://www.philsci.org/announcements/archive-of-announcement/24-announcements/archived-announcements/139-lakatos-award-2012">www.philsci.org/announcements/archive-of-announcement/24-announcements/archived-announcements/139-lakatos-award-2012</a>.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Second, it sounds as if Lakatos must have done something praiseworthy if he took part in “radical educational reform for universal access to Higher Education on the basis of merit.” But wait, this was all happening immediately after the Communist takeover in Hungary, right? And isn’t it well known that such “radical educational reforms” in postwar Eastern Europe never involved meritocracy but that rather, without exception, they ended with ideological indoctrination, censorship, and persecution of remaining “bourgeois elements” and other “enemies of the people”? So perhaps there is nothing to celebrate about Lakatos’s “playing a highly influential role” in actions of the Ministry of Education?</p>
<p class="bodytext-bs">Indeed, there is evidence that Lakatos should be condemned, not celebrated, for his “role” in the Ministry of Education:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Lakatos worked for the Ministry of Education between 1945 and 1948, and was an active writer supporting the hard Party line against the liberal factions to be demolished by [Hungarian Prime Minister Matyas] Rakosi. During the <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_110" title="110"></span>1947–1948 academic year, Lakatos dedicated himself to helping destroy the distinguished Eötvös College, targeted by the Communists because of its resistance to transforming itself into an indoctrination tool like the recently established Györffy College. . . . In articles and speeches, Lakatos polemicized against the Eötvös curriculum, intimating that the college provided no significant resistance against the fascists and was unsympathetic to the aims of a people’s democracy. The college’s goals, argued the young Lakatos, were fundamentally elitist, and thus, unsupportive of the great social transformation taking place. . . . [A]nd in 1950, [the Minister of Culture József] Révai disbanded Eötvös College. . . . As a reward, Lakatos was sent to study in Moscow (Kadvany 2001, 288–89).</p>
<p class="bodytext-ts">Apparently, the real goal was not to implement universal access to higher education but rather to destroy an institution of higher learning with a long tradition and excellent academic reputation, and through <i>Gleichschaltung</i> turn it into yet another gray Party-controlled school. Moreover, Lakatos’s getting a reward for his effort indicates that his actions were probably regarded as a key part of the successfully accomplished mission.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Before his destructive actions at Eötvös College, Lakatos was one of the leaders of a student group, Debrecen University Circle, which not only demanded the dismissal of “reactionary” professors but also established a “screening committee” aiming to “cleanse the student body of fascists and reactionaries who had wormed their way into the ranks” (Bandy 2009, 59–61).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Ralf Dahrendorf, former director of the London School of Economics, says Lakatos was “reared by” the Marxist philosopher György Lukács (Dahrendorf 1995, 425). In reality, Lakatos’s association with Lukács included digging up compromising quotes from Lukács and providing other information to the Party ideologue László Rudas when he attacked Lukács for “right deviation” in 1949. (As a consequence of Rudas’s accusations, Lukács was forced out of public life for years.) A secret police document kept in the Historical Archives of the State Security Services says that <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_111" title="111"></span>Gábor Kovács (Lakatos’s codename as an informer) “gave us valuable information about [György Lukács’ circle]” (Bandy undated, 5). According to the philosopher Agnes Heller, Lukács was aware that Lakatos was helping the Party build an ideological case against him and once said resignedly: “So much for disciples.”</p>
<p class="bodytext-bs">And third, the information on LSE’s website and elsewhere (Godfrey-Smith 2009, 103) that Lakatos ended up as a <i>political</i> prisoner in Stalinist Hungary will naturally be interpreted as suggesting this happened because he opposed, or was perceived to oppose, Stalinist policies. In all likelihood, hardly anyone would consider the possibility that he was a political prisoner simply because he was <i>more</i> Stalinist than many of the leaders of the Hungarian Communist Party. But there is evidence that this was exactly the case. It seems, furthermore, that Lakatos actually remained a Stalinist even after leaving prison:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Lakatos was expelled from the Party and taken into custody by the ávh [Hungarian secret police], possibly because of a plan to denounce Révai [a Communist politician and the Minister of Culture at the time] as an imperialist agent based on Lakatos’s research: Révai, for Lakatos, <i>was not Stalinist enough</i>. . . . Lakatos nonetheless may still have been cooperating at Recsk with the ávh. Lakatos maintained the Party line after his release, arguing that Rákosi must have had good reasons for his actions. <i>He continued, as he had for years, to spy and inform on others, including his mentor Árpád Szabó</i>. Recall that after the prisoners’ release, the writers and others were opposed in two camps supporting Nagy [reformist Communist] and Rákosi [Stalinist]. <i>Lakatos was still a staunch Rákosi backer</i> (Kadvany 2001, 290; emphasis added).</p>
<p class="bodytext-ts">Speaking of Árpád Szabó (who was one of his closest friends and a witness at his wedding): Lakatos went so far as to search Szabó’s wastebasket in the hope of finding something incriminating (Congdon 1997, 281).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now, it is surely appalling that Lakatos was forced to spend three years in a labor camp without being tried for any crime. Yet <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_112" title="112"></span>it is unclear why the LSE website would describe this unfortunate episode evasively and misleadingly so as to insinuate an act of anti-totalitarian resistance that in fact did not happen.</p>
<p class="subheading" id="asec23"><a href="Contents.xhtml#sec23">Murder by Suicide</a></p>
<p class="normal">Another key event in Lakatos’s life (left out in his LSE biography) that casts an even darker shadow over his character has to do with his role in the suicide in 1944 of a young woman named Éva Izsák. I will present the basic facts of this case by relying on a number of sources, including a transcription of the hearings conducted at the Political Department of the State Police in Nagyvárad (the city’s Romanian name is Oradea) on June 18 and 19, 1945. This document is appended to a moving essay written by Izsák’s sister, Mária Zimán, in which at the beginning she says something striking (that will make more sense in a moment): “Éva was the victim of a cruel age, the age of Hitlerism. But her execution outdid even the most devious methods of execution of the time” (Zimán 1989).</p>
<p class="bodytext">During World War II Lakatos joined the Communist Party and became the unofficial leader of a small underground cell in Nagyvárad. One of the cell members was a nineteen-year-old Jewish woman, Éva Izsák. She, like many other members, was in hiding and had false papers. It was feared she was a particular security risk for the whole group—that she was more likely to be arrested and that she might be forced to disclose information about her comrades. This problem had to be addressed and there was no doubt about who should be in charge: Imre Lipsitz (Lakatos’s original surname), the cell’s undisputed leader as well as the authority on Marxism, political issues, strategy questions, and basically everything else. He didn’t disappoint, coming up with a totally unexpected idea, or what one later commentator called an “insane proposal” (Kadvany 2012, 277): The best way out was for Éva Izsák to commit suicide.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The proposal was supported by an argument couched by the future LSE professor in terms of Marxist dialectics which the other members found so compelling that they all immediately voted <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_113" title="113"></span>for it—including Éva’s own boyfriend! In that fateful meeting, Lakatos’s girlfriend requested that she get Éva’s winter coat after her death, which was approved.</p>

<p class="caption" id="ach7fig2"><a href="Credits.xhtml#ch2fig2">FIGURE 7.2: Éva Izsák (1925–1944)</a></p>
<p class="bodytext-bs">After poor Éva learned about the decision, she only asked whether there was some other way. As a witness later recounted to the police, Lakatos explained that “there was no other solution and that what we prove theoretically . . . we must also realize in practice, so she had to do it.” And she did. She first had to travel to a remote place where her dead body would not be recognized by anyone. She was accompanied by another trusted Communist, Nyuszi Levente, whose duty was to prepare things and make sure there was no change of heart at the last minute:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Nyuszi told us that when he and Éva went to Nagyerdő, they looked for a deserted place where no one ever goes. He had the water with him and then Éva took the poison when it was growing dark already. Nyuszi told Éva that it would be over in a few moments. After Éva drank it, Éva was so strong and brave that she even asked Nyuszi when would it be over, but she couldn’t finish the sentence, because she collapsed, made a rattling sound, and Nyuszi, allegedly, closed her mouth which was foaming (report of Alfonz Weisz, a member of Lakatos’s Communist cell: police interrogation in 1945).</p>
<p class="bodytext-ts"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_114" title="114"></span>When Elie Wiesel read about the death of Éva Izsák, his comment was: “Jews killing Jews! In the midst of the Holocaust! I have never heard of anything like that!” (quoted in Bandy 2009, 49).</p>
<p class="bodytext">The sad thing is that in reality there was no reason whatsoever for Éva Izsák to die. Before her suicide, her sister (also a Communist) was doing everything she could to get in touch with her and bring her to a safe place. However, she was unable to make any contact because all communication with Éva had to go through the cell leaders (who even opened her mail). They inexplicably refused to respond in any way to her sister’s letters and inquiries. When a good friend of Éva’s came to Nagyvárad to pick her up and take her to a safe house in another city, this friend was informed that Éva had already left, although she was in fact still there, while the group, under the influence of their forceful leader, was strangely unwilling to consider any alternative to the suicide “solution.”</p>
<p class="bodytext-bs">Furthermore, this way of dealing with comrades who were regarded as a security risk was simply unheard of at the time. Imre Tóth, a philosopher of mathematics who was at the end of the war involved in the same kind of underground activity in Hungary as Lakatos, later said:</p>
<p class="blockquote">[The death sentence] by a perverse suicide as imposed by Imre Lakatos was even at this time and in its referential system in flagrant contradiction with all the tactical, political and moral standards of the underground movement. It was certainly an absolutely subjective invention of Imre Lakatos. And taking into account the Jewish background of Imre Lakatos, it remains a horrible singularity (quoted in Bandy 2009, 49).</p>
<p class="bodytext-ts">Lakatos was such a dominating influence on the minds of other group members that they were ready to obey all his instructions unconditionally. In some respects the atmosphere resembled that of a sect like Jim Jones’s infamous People’s Temple community in Jonestown. Apparently even the idea of a collective suicide was mentioned at one point, which shows that in the case of Éva Izsák too this kind of proposal may have been Lakatos’s way of testing <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_115" title="115"></span>whether there were any limits to his subordinates’ obedience. “And when Imre Lipsitz told us on the banks of the Körös [River] that we must also commit suicide, we would have obeyed just as Éva did, but then he laughed to show that it was just a ‘test’ to see whether or not we would submit” (transcript of the police interrogation in 1945).</p>
<p class="bodytext">LSE philosopher John Worrall once said Lakatos was “an exceptional human being” (1976, 1). Information from many sources (some of which has been cited here) confirms this statement, but not in the way Worrall intended. Lakatos’s extreme manipulativeness, unscrupulousness, lack of concern for other people, and rigid loyalty to a totalitarian ideology make a combination that is, if not unique, certainly quite rare.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Worrall, who is also the convener of the Lakatos Award committee at LSE, appears to be particularly ill-disposed toward negative personal characterizations of his former teacher. So when on the basis of the aforementioned facts one scholar described Lakatos as “a dangerous thug with something like a criminal record, and who consistently displayed a pattern of dissemblance and cunning across the decades” (Kadvany 2001, 314), Worrall called this “an appalling, perhaps even libelous remark” (Worrall 2003, 83). Worrall’s indignation is misplaced. This allegedly “appalling” remark seems to be tracking the known facts about Lakatos pretty well. It is the reality that is appalling, not the words describing it. According to Kadvany, it was actually Bernard Williams, the preeminent British moral philosopher, who once described Lakatos as “a kind of a thug.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Someone might say that, in terms of the main theme of this book, in Lakatos’s case it was more the heart, rather than reason, that went on holiday. There is some truth to this. Yes, a certain coldheartedness, to put it very mildly, is evident in some of the episodes described above. This is additionally corroborated in judgments from acquaintances and commentators who said, among other things, that he was “evil” (Joseph Agassi, philosopher and colleague), that he was “an impossible infantile monster, completely unable to understand other people” (a former girlfriend), that he was “not fully human,” that “his drives and his mind are in place, <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_116" title="116"></span>but the rest missing” (a mathematician colleague), that “people did not matter to him,” that he was “a truly Satanic figure” and that “it was scary to see him in action” (a historian colleague), that he was “diabolic” (philosopher Agnes Heller), that he was seen as “an evil spirit” and “demonic” (Endre Ságvári a Communist activist), that he was “diabolic” in his “total disregard for people” (István Márkus, a journal editor), that he was “like the devil . . . absolutely inhuman . . . that he had no human feelings for anyone . . . and that he would trample on anyone to get ahead” (András Nagy, professor of economics), that he was “a Satanic figure” (an editor Zoltán Zsámboki), that he was “unbelievably unscrupulous” (Péter Németh, a literary historian), that he “met the criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder in the current DSM IV” (Long 2002, 294). All in all, a lot of the evidence points to the possibility that Lakatos was a psychopath, which is indeed how he was described by Dr. Klára Majerszky, who worked at the National Psychiatric and Neurological Institute in Budapest and who knew Lakatos personally before the war<sup><a href="#krch7fn1" id="kch7fn1">1</a></sup> (Bandy 2009, 123).</p>
<p class="bodytext">On the other hand, though, such a radical deficit of empathy would certainly not be incompatible with a cognitive failure. And there is some evidence for that too.</p>
<p class="subheading" id="asec24"><a href="Contents.xhtml#sec24">Sticking with the Superego</a></p>
<p class="normal">Needless to say, there was nothing inherently irrational about adopting the Marxist ideology and becoming a member of the Communist Party during World War II in Hungary, especially for someone like Lakatos whose closest family members were persecuted and eventually perished in the Holocaust. But the fact that he kept the true Stalinist faith until 1956 (as he apparently did) is much harder to understand, particularly given his indisputable <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_117" title="117"></span>intellectual brilliance as well as his easy access to information that was unavailable to others. (From 1953 until his departure from Hungary in 1956 Lakatos worked in a library where he could freely read a lot of sources that were strictly forbidden to the public, including books of his later teacher and prominent anti-Marxist, Karl Popper.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">Yet in a 1971 letter to the psychologist Paul Meehl, Lakatos says that the Communist Party was his last superego and that <i>it was only in 1956</i> that he finally got rid of that superego. He is not more specific about the time when this happened, but one Lakatos scholar dates his break with the Party to the autumn of 1956 (Kadvany 2001, 290). This is embarrassingly late if we remember that the Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest on October 24, 1956.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Let us telegraphically review a sequence of excellent but strangely missed opportunities for Lakatos to recognize the monstrosity of the regime that he had so faithfully served for years. When in 1947 some leading members of a non-Communist party that had won the first election in postwar Hungary were accused by the Communist Minister of Internal Affairs, László Rajk, of plotting against the state and were then either executed or given long prison sentences, wasn’t that very odd? Wasn’t that a clear reason to have doubts about what one’s “superego” was really up to? And when two years later that same László Rajk was officially tried (and soon executed) for being a Titoist spy, an agent of Western Imperialism, and for trying to restore capitalism and undermine Hungary’s independence, didn’t all this raise at least some suspicion about what was really going on? And if not, why not? Also, didn’t Lakatos’s terrible three-year experience of being illegally imprisoned in a labor camp and leaving that place of abuse with broken and missing teeth move him to start harboring some distrust toward the Party that obviously stood behind that experience?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Apparently not, because even after his release Lakatos defended his own internment, saying “the Party must have had some good reason for what it did” (Congdon 1997, 289). And if, as Solzhenitsyn said, Marxism in the Soviet Union “has fallen to such a low point that it has become a joke, an object of contempt . . . and that no <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_118" title="118"></span>serious person, not even university and high-school students, can talk about Marxism without a smile or a sneer” (1976, 47), how is it possible that a genius with a doctorate in philosophy<sup><a href="#krch7fn2" id="kch7fn2">2</a></sup> took seriously the official ideology that was drenched in the tired and ridiculous rote formulas of dialectical materialism?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Paradoxically, this was the man who had such a penetrating mind that in London in 1961 he wrote a thesis that would soon be universally regarded as a stunningly original and highly influential contribution to philosophy of mathematics. But just five years earlier this same man was still incapable of extricating himself from the clutches of a totally ludicrous philosophical doctrine or distancing himself from the manifestly inhumane political regime that was based on that ideology.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And to make matters worse, according to a letter from MI5 October 10, 1962, to the Home Office, Lakatos, who was then already a lecturer at the London School of Economics, was still collaborating with the Hungarian secret police (see Bandy 2009, 304). This is apparently why his application for British citizenship was refused. He tried again in 1967, this time garnering the support of luminaries like Sir Karl Popper, who assured the British authorities that Lakatos “had broken with his communist past before he left Hungary,” and the LSE economist Lord Lionel Robbins, who called Lakatos “a man of outstanding qualities of intellect <i>and character</i>” (emphasis added). But the request was refused again; Home Secretary Roy Jenkins approached Lord Robbins and explained that the negative decision was made after “full and careful consideration.” Clearly there must have been powerful evidence behind the refusal, but its nature was never as much as hinted at.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another puzzling thing, touched on earlier, is the tendency of some of the most prominent Lakatos-related sources today to omit compromising information about him, or even sometimes to twist it so that it appears less unfavorable. In some sense this is understandable, for if one is receiving, and especially if one is bestowing, <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_119" title="119"></span>a coveted award named after X, one will naturally be reluctant to loudly announce to the world that X was in fact an ultra-Stalinist and a secret police informer or that X was assisting the Party apparatchiks in their ideological attacks on fellow philosophers and that he was directly responsible for the cruel and pointless death of an innocent and vulnerable young woman.<sup><a href="#krch7fn3" id="kch7fn3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="bodytext">Nevertheless, hushing up or de-emphasizing this kind of biographical information is surprising. Would philosophers be equally cagey about mentioning (or reacting to) such publicly accessible information about one of their own if it turned out he had done something similar to what Lakatos had—with the only difference being that he was in the service not of Stalin but, say, Franco, Pinochet, or Hitler? To ask that question is to answer it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A striking contrast: Lakatos’s real-life actions that caused loss of life and immense human suffering have barely produced a yawn among philosophers; meanwhile, in another case, top scholars in the profession have issued strident condemnations and repeatedly expressed disbelief and shock over what one old and disillusioned man had written in the last year of his life in his <i>private</i> diary, which was published seventy years after his death (see <a href="Chapter013.xhtml#page_188">pp. 188–193</a>).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another pertinent example is the German philosopher Günter Figal, who recently stepped down as the chair of the Martin Heidegger Society after learning about the appalling extent of Heidegger’s anti-Semitism, which has been revealed in the newly published <i>Black Notebooks</i> of Heidegger. In an interview in the <i>Badische Zeitung</i> Figal said this discovery was “a compelling reason for him to rethink his relation to Heidegger as a person” and added: “The ever more pressing question for me was the following: do I want, with my core beliefs, to be associated with this person? And the answer was a clear No” (Schulte 2015).</p>
<p class="bodytext">In a further development, these recent discoveries have caused so much embarrassment that the University of Freiburg <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_120" title="120"></span>has abolished Heidegger’s former chair and, the ultimate insult, replaced it with a junior professorship in analytic philosophy! (Kaube 2015). Although this reaction is regarded by some philosophers as excessive, it shows that, as a matter of fact, many do feel an irresistible impulse to disassociate themselves from the name of anyone who plunged so deeply into political irrationality and totalitarian insanity. Again, I am not supporting this impulse but just registering its existence and its apparently wide appeal on some occasions, but notably not on others.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Although the cases of Heidegger and Lakatos are similar in an important way—each of them played an active, infamous role in an odious political regime of his own country—they are of course very different in many respects. So I am not suggesting that our reactions to their misdeeds should necessarily be the same. But something else is also worth stressing: Differences between the two cases are not always in Lakatos’s favor. After all, Heidegger is not known to have been directly responsible for anyone’s death.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="krch7fn1"><a href="#kch7fn1">1</a> Interestingly, although the authors of the 2016 article about Lakatos in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy seem to be aware of the severely negative comments about Lakatos’s character from many of his friends and close acquaintances, all this is inexplicably disregarded and the biographical part of the article begins with the blithe statement that “Imre Lakatos was a warm and witty friend.”</p>
<p class="footnote" id="krch7fn2"><a href="#kch7fn2">2</a> Lakatos received his first Ph.D., from the University of Debrecen, in 1947, <i>summa cum laude</i>.</p>
