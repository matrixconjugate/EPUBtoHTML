A woman who reviewed books for Boston newspapers had made a small side living out of driving the box loads of free review copies she received from publishers to local fairs and libraries to sell them at a steep discount from the cover price. Tired of hauling books, she sold a garageful of them and her list of contacts to Strymish for $1,000, $500 of which he had borrowed from a friend. “I was buying good will and inventory,” Strymish liked to tell people later. “At least I got some inventory.” The business would be, he declared, the first step toward opening a bookstore.</p><p>Running a bookstore had been a long-standing dream for Strymish, who as a child had been so introverted and so bedeviled by dyslexia, a then-unrecognized disability, that some teachers suspected he was retarded. Largely by sheer force of will, he learned to deal with the jumble of letters that faced him on every page, eventually fashioning himself into a prolific and enthusiastic reader who would carry on a lifelong love affair with the printed word. While earning his degree in chemistry from Harvard, he raised much of his tuition hawking newspapers from the slush near Boston’s South Station, wrestling with the <em>New York Times</em> crossword puzzle during quiet moments. But postcollege life as a technician in New England’s decaying leather industry proved neither emotionally nor financially rewarding. He found himself gravitating toward publishing and was selling magazine subscriptions when he came across the opportunity to plunge into the bookselling business. Or at least into an odd corner of it, one that left him peddling reviewed, damaged, excess stock and other cheap books to fairgoers and librarians as the proprietor and staff of the New England Mobile Book Fair. A year later, with another loan from his friend, he was able to open a small bookstore in the West Roxbury section of Boston, which retained the festive name.</p><p>Strymish didn’t set up his bookstore to be like other bookstores. To take advantage of his existing inventory, he ran it as a small wholesale warehouse, specializing in bargain books, intended to appeal to librarians and other bookstore owners. Unlike typical bookstore customers, such wholesale buyers are not generally looking for a few particular books or books on a particular subject, and they don’t need a cozy atmosphere to facilitate the casual browsing and test-driving of books. So to save time and money, Strymish simply pulled books out of the boxes in which publishers had packed them and plunked them down onto rows of flimsy wooden shelving, leaving them clumped by publisher and bothering to do no further sorting. If a librarian or bookstore owner needed a specific title, author, or subject, he didn’t have to be told how to identify the books’ publishers via the <em>Books In Print</em> catalog, which Strymish kept on hand to supplement his own considerable knowledge of the inventory. The savings from not putting the books in order helped fuel deeper discounts for customers.</p><p>Supported by no retail advertising, and displaying only a tiny, uninviting sign out front, Strymish’s bookstore wasn’t easily mistaken for a conventional one. Still, curious civilians occasionally wandered in off the street, only to be promptly baffled. It wasn’t just the chintzy, cramped decor, complete with half-unpacked boxes and piles of unshelved books, that made the place look like a mess. To the typical book browser, the shelves seemed at first to be an undecodable hodgepodge. If one of these customers asked where to find the books on history or auto mechanics or classic literature, Strymish would blithely rattle off the names of a few publishers or point the confused shopper toward <em>Books In Print.</em> In a sense, the store was the opposite of another recently opened Boston-area business called Harvey’s Hardware. Both stores seemed disordered compared to competitors, if in different ways, but where Harvey Katz was forcing customers at his hardware store to rely on human guides to the confusion, Strymish required his customers to master it on their own.</p><p>Many customers fled, of course, leaving Strymish shrugging behind them. But a good number were sufficiently enticed by the cheap prices to stay and browse. And a funny thing happened: once people got the hang of shopping by publisher, they tended to like it. Though the public is mostly oblivious to who publishes which books, when readers start paying attention they discover that certain publishers put out books more likely to appeal to certain tastes. And when forced to browse through a single publisher’s books, customers end up stumbling on interesting books they never would have sought out. Word started to get out among book lovers in university-lousy Greater Boston that the small warehouse was a stimulating and rewarding, if slightly goofy, place to stumble through an eclectic and oddly arranged selection of discount books.</p><p>Today the New England Mobile Book Fair—or “Strymish’s,” as it’s known locally—stands within five miles of two Barnes &amp; Noble and two Borders stores comprising some 120,000 square feet of direct competition. The squat, featureless warehouse—originally a tennis-racket factory—is surrounded by retail clothing stores and restaurants serving the affluent western suburbs of Boston. With only modest indication of what wares are housed inside, the independent bookstore still outsells each of the four superstores in the area.</p><p>A first question might be why, if one was going to set oneself up in a nondescript warehouse, one would bother to do so in a relatively high-priced retail mecca. The answer is that Strymish <em>didn’t</em> plunk his store in the middle of all this; when he opened it in 1965, a few years after his first store was gutted in a fire, it was a lone outpost of relatively genteel business neighbored by welding shops and lumberyards. The other stores built around him over the years, ultimately proving Strymish to be, on top of everything else, an unlikely visionary of suburban commercial development. (The warehouse today is actually a larger, but no less utilitarian, version of the original.)</p><p>Though still a favorite of librarians and other wholesale buyers, the New England Mobile Book Fair is mostly a retail operation now and has been for decades. But don’t tell this to the shoppers who pick their way through the dense, dingy, 35,000-square-foot forest of cheap, cramped shelving creaking with some two million titles. Many of the customers think they’re crashing a wholesale outlet. What retailer would make it this hard to find a book? Of course, to come to the Book Fair to find a specific book is to miss part of the point. What the store excels at is providing an opportunity to find what you <em>aren’t</em> looking for. But even so, a customer who is looking for a specific title or a book by a specific author will probably find it faster here than she would in a Borders. Or so argues Jon Strymish, one of Louis’s sons. That’s because categorizing books by subjects, as virtually all bookstores do, isn’t as helpful as people perceive it to be. “If you’re looking for a book by Julia Child, you know it’s going to be in cookbooks,” he says. “But often you’ll have trouble guessing what category a book is in.” Take the book you’re reading right now, for example. Would you have been able to guess how bookstores would categorize it? One Barnes &amp; Noble store manager said she had no idea where it would be stocked, but suggested that was par for the course. The publisher usually recommends a category, she noted, adding, “Sometimes we just take our best guess, and that’s where it ends up.” A manager at a Waldenbooks store noted that how a book is categorized sometimes depends on which employee unpacks the box.</p><p>But since shoppers for a particular book or author at conventional bookstores tend to think they can guess the subject, they usually give it a try first, hunting down the appropriate section and scanning the shelves there for the book, typically failing and trying a different subject or two before giving up and asking an employee. At the Book Fair, the strange organization scheme usually inspires the hunter of a specific book or author to give up at the outset and head straight to the store’s copies of <em>Books In Print</em>—or more likely to the computer terminals that have since automated that catalog’s function—to find the book’s publisher. (Within publisher sections, books are alphabetized by author.) “It’s like the Dewey decimal system—it might be hard to guess what a book’s number is, but it’s easy to look it up and go right to it,” says Jon. One could rightly argue that an advantage of grouping books by subject is that it gives readers a chance to browse through the books whose topics they’re especially interested in. But that assumes people want only books that neatly fall into a standard subject, which is often not the case.</p><p>Louis Strymish passed away in 1983, and now Jon, forty-three, owns the company with his brother David. Jon’s features are somehow both sensitive and primitive, and they are set over a hulking, slightly stooped frame—the bookstore clerk that time forgot. As he lumbers and lurches down the crazed, narrow aisles at speed, unable to resist grabbing books that are out of place and reshelving them on the fly, he has no trouble clearing a path through the clots of browsers; one mother seems to sense him coming, as if spotting ripples in a cup of liquid, and reflexively scoops her child well out of the way. As in his father’s day, a certain amount of customer assistance is available, but the emphasis is on figuring it out on your own. Jon stops to discreetly listen in on a confused first-time customer standing at a computer terminal who has flagged down a harried employee to help him find the work of a particular author. “What was I doing wrong?” the customer asks, as the employee deftly pulls up the author’s listings. “It wasn’t you, it’s the computer,” she replies generously and describes what she had done to find them. Then she briskly leads the customer to the shelves where the publisher can be found—the publishers’ names are handwritten on irregularly shaped rectangles of paper taped or stapled onto the shelves—and helps him locate the author. Jon grunts, apparently in approval. It has taken a few minutes, but now one more book shopper knows how to deal with the Book Fair system; he may never have to seek an employee’s help here again.</p><p>But even aside from the leap to computer cataloging, the Book Fair is not a frozen, super-sized incarnation of Louis Strymish’s original vision. Actually, it has become a fairly complex business, though it’s not the sort of complexity of which a management-consulting firm might approve. Instead, it’s now a crazy quilt of a company, a mix of the eclectic, eccentric styles of the people who run it. It isn’t a total mess; rather, some aspects of the business are messy in some dimensions, to some extent, and in ways that change over time. You might say it’s malleably semimessy.</p><p>One of the people who make it so is Steve Gans, the company’s chief operating officer and general counsel, the son of the man who twice loaned Louis money in the 1950s to get started. Gans grew up playing with Jon and David and did time as an attorney at a major Boston law firm before he finally recognized in 1993 that Book Fair resistance was futile. A good-naturedly frantic man in jeans and sneakers, Gans operates out of the landing of a stairway that leads to the roof. He tried to requisition an actual room for an office when he signed up, but was told by Jon that God intended actual rooms to serve as places to pile books, and any person who thought he could find space to wedge a desk between the piles was welcome to try. Since Gans’s legal work required a certain measure of privacy, he took over the only unburied, quiet eight square feet in the entire vast facility. The only reason that stairway was free, he notes, is because using it for storage would have defied fire codes. Even here, numerous boxes sponge up the little space not taken up by his desk.</p><p>As seems to be the case for everyone who works at the company, Gans’s job description includes doing pretty much whatever he wants, as long as there’s some chance that it will contribute to the business or at least not hurt it too much. Gans started a cookbook publishing company under the Book Fair umbrella called Biscuit Books. “We had no time for it, but we thought we’d have fun with it,” he explains. He was inspired by the cookbook sales business David Strymish had already cofounded called Jessica’s Biscuit (named after two dogs), which was in turn followed by a coffee bean–sales business that occasioned the importing of an industrial roaster into the company.</p><p>The Book Fair’s competition is quite a bit steeper now than in Louis’s days. For starters there are the superstores, though Gans is relatively sanguine about them, noting that in 1995, the year the first Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders opened up down the road, the Book Fair’s sales rose 10 percent. Though the privately held company doesn’t release financial information, past comments by the Strymish brothers and Gans suggest that annual sales for the bookstore float in the $10 million range, not including another few million dollars from Jessica’s Biscuit. In comparison, average single-store sales for Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders are around half that much.</p><p>Amazon.com is another matter. “Amazon costs us millions,” says Gans. In particular, Amazon has proved a vicious competitor to Jessica’s Biscuit, which focuses on discount online sales of cookbooks. Gans describes how Amazon once dropped its prices on all twelve books featured in Jessica’s catalog just a few hours after the catalog was e-mailed to customers. Sales commenced a two-year plunge at Jessica’s when Amazon started offering free shipping for orders of at least $25 at the end of 2002, until Jessica’s found a way to match the offer. Jessica’s has beefed up its call center and fulfillment operation to chase some of Amazon’s efficiencies, all while continuing to avoid looking anything like a tightly run organization. It’s inventory room, for instance, looks less like one of Amazon’s celebratedly hyperordered, Segway-scooterized warehouses than what one imagines the inside of one of those warehouse’s Dumpsters might look like. Gans assesses it as if realizing what it must look like to an outsider and shrugs. “Okay, it’s not as organized as it could be,” he says. “But if a customer asks us for a book, our people can find it right away.” In any case, he adds, Jessica’s can and sometimes does toss in a bag of coffee beans as a customer incentive.</p><p>The mother store has quietly undergone change as well, under the laid-back guidance of Jon, who has still found time to build a very modest second career as a photographer of musicians and an even more modest third career as a bassist for bands. He has applied this same mixed focus to stocking an amalgam of new and bargain books that has proved one of the store’s signature features. While acquiring a larger selection of new hardcover and paperback books than even most superstores offer, Jon has maintained a vaster-than-ever collection of the same sort of steeply discounted damaged and publisher’s excess books with which Louis Strymish grew the business. To wring out the maximum discount, Jon will often negotiate for a publisher’s entire stock of remainder or damaged books, as when he took five hundred copies of Edward Gorey’s <em>The Headless Bust</em>—a book that probably saw no order larger than a dozen from any other bookstore in the world.</p><p>This sort of going out on a limb for books that have no obvious promise of finding an audience—and that aren’t returnable to publishers if unsold—is virtually unheard of in the bookselling industry. “The new-book business depresses me sometimes,” he says. “It’s like a fashion business. What sells is what was pushed on TV this week, and the rest get returned. A bargain book gets sold because someone made a commitment to it out of faith that someone would buy it someday.” But the unpredictability of bargain books comes with rewards. The large mishmash of odd books available for a song is not only one of Strymish’s big draws, it’s also a money machine. Although new books account for 70 percent of the store’s revenues, bargain books make up 70 percent of the profits, because Jon gets them so cheaply that he can mark them up as much as 300 percent and still sell them for five dollars or less. In a sense, new books, with their slim margins, are loss leaders at the Book Fair.</p><p>Even the Book Fair’s signature by-publisher organization is slowly mutating under improvisation and experimentation. Jon lets employees set up subject-oriented sections whenever they feel like it and stock them with whatever books seem appropriate. These categories don’t always track the standard ones; there’s a conventional travel section, but there’s also a tattoo/body art section. Employees sometimes get carried away with categorizing, as when one fellow set up ten different religious sections; Jon himself started to have trouble finding books there, so he scaled it back to two sections. Other employees have set up interesting blends of by-publisher and by-subject sections, so that, for example, a science-fiction section in paperbacks is perched alongside a section dedicated to books from science-fiction and fantasy publisher Wizards of the Coast. Other books never make it into any sort of category—an employee will just randomly lay them out in the sea of bins and unlabeled display cases near the front for a customer to stumble over rather than intentionally look up. “It’s a mix of organizing styles,” says Jon. “It seems to happen naturally, and it seems to work okay. My goal is to make sure changes don’t happen so fast that they can’t be reversed if they don’t work. But whatever you do, you’re going to annoy someone.” Actually, it’s hard to spot a single customer in the store who looks the least bit annoyed. But then, that wouldn’t include those first-timers who even today walk in and find the store so perplexing that they turn and flee.</p><p class="spb">Organizations are defined to some extent by the way they are organized. The general assumption is that success is related to the degree of organization—more always being better, of course—and to the type of order. This bias extends from the most elemental levels of organizational functioning, such as shuffling paperwork, up through the critical strategic decisions made by senior managers, and applies as well to issues of organizational structure. But as we’ve seen with people and homes, there are many ways in which order can cause, rather than solve, problems, and many ways to be usefully messy. Here are a few of the ways this notion can apply to different types of organizations.</p><p class="h1">File This</p><p class="p1">Despite Pendaflex’s best efforts, you’d probably have trouble naming any major innovations in the filing of paper documents since the invention of the filing cabinet. But, in fact, there has been one: the Noguchi filing system. Yukio Noguchi is a Japanese economist revered in his country not only for his intellectual wattage but also for his work in designing and promoting personal organizing systems, or, as he calls the endeavor, “hyperorganization,” intended to maximize the efficiency of office workers. Though Noguchi’s schemes haven’t received much attention outside of Japan, a translator by the name of William Lise took the trouble to post on his normally obscure Web site what may have been the first English-language description of Noguchi’s filing system and was stunned to receive some forty thousand visitors to that page in a single three-week period in 2005.</p><p>The gist of the Noguchi scheme is this: every single incoming document, no matter what it is, is placed in a large envelope. The contents are noted on the side of the envelope, which is then placed on its edge on a shelf, so that all the envelopes line up in a horizontal row like books. New envelopes are inserted on the left side of the row, and any envelope that’s taken out is put back on the left. After a while, those envelopes that contain the most recent and most often accessed documents will end up on the left side of the row, while the oldest and least used documents will be on the right. In theory, this makes documents easier to access, since they are automatically prioritized by frequency of use. If something seems vaguely familiar about the arrangement, perhaps it’s this: Turn the row of envelopes so that the envelopes are stacked vertically instead of horizontally, place the stack on your desktop, and get rid of the envelopes. Now you’ve got an ordinary pile of papers of the sort that you’d find on any messy desk, where the most recent and most used items tend to end up at the top. So the next time someone tells you your pile-covered desk is messy, you can point out that it’s just hyperorganized.</p><p>The fact is, no matter how you go about organizing a workplace, others are going to find fault with your scheme. One school administrator describes how the week before school starts in September is always a mad flurry of classroom organizing on the parts of the teachers, even though the classrooms are perfectly neat and organized to begin with. The problem is that the teachers switch classrooms during the summer sessions, and, since no teacher ever seems to find any other teacher’s organization scheme remotely acceptable, the rooms—desks, tables, books, supplies, files, wall hangings—always end up being completely rearranged by their summer occupants, which means they have to be re-rearranged again in September when the teachers return to their regular classrooms.</p><p>Teachers are just amateurs at organization, of course. How do the real pros handle heavy-duty office organizing? The mother of all document-management challenges may well arise at law firms whose large corporate clients are hit with legal actions. Lawsuits, criminal investigations, and regulatory disputes often begin with a demand for all documents that might be relevant to the action, and document counts routinely mount into the millions. Complying can be relatively easy—it’s often just a matter of scooping out the contents of a filing-cabinet forest, putting it in boxes, and shipping it off. The problem arises when it comes time to refile everything. One law firm involved in a major energy-industry legal case recruited a team of workers to handle that odious task after the action. The team spent several days neatly filing away ten file cabinets’ worth of documents, and then gave up and randomly stuffed the other 95 percent or so of the documents into the remaining hundred or so file cabinets. On more than one occasion, members of the filing team were asked how to find particular documents, and the reply was always the same: check the first ten filing cabinets. This seemed a sensible answer, for the same reason that the drunk fellow, as the old joke goes, was looking for his car keys underneath the light of a street lamp rather than across the street where he dropped them—it’s less frustrating to look for something in the spot where locating it seems possible, even if it’s far more likely to be somewhere else. In any case, lawyers at other firms confirm that the careful filing or refiling of a huge collection of documents is not only a waste of effort but also can actually cause more problems than it solves. When an organization is hit with a demand for particular documents, it is typically entirely to its advantage to be able to honestly claim that it has no idea where those documents are, but that the demander is free to pick through a few hundred randomly stuffed file cabinets to find them. Unfortunately for publicly held U.S. companies, filing laxness is no longer an option, thanks to section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed by Congress in 2002, which among other things requires extensive and precise financial-document tracking. According to a survey conducted by AMR Research, the estimated cost of compliance with the act in 2005—the first full year in which section 404 was in effect—was $6.1 billion. Congress expected high initial compliance costs when it passed the act but assured industry that those costs would quickly go down. Predicted costs of compliance in 2006, according to the same survey: $6.0 billion.</p><p>In general, there can be quite a lot of method to the seeming madness of the messy office worker—or the “Scruffy,” as David Kirsh likes to say. Kirsh is a cognitive science researcher at the University of California at San Diego who studies messy and neat offices. He’s not interested in taking sides in a value-of-order debate but, rather, in simply understanding what is going on when an office is neat or messy. Kirsh, who looks a bit like a cerebral version of Larry of the Three Stooges, spends much of his time bouncing around a small, noisy lab packed with graduate students and computer monitors, including one large-screen display mounted next to a video camera on a wall that presents a view of students bustling around another small lab. The screen is an “electronic window” that lets the occupants of the two labs feel more connected—the other lab is also under his direction and has a similar display and video camera on one wall. This type of virtual link is not unheard of in high-tech labs, but Kirsh’s other lab turns out to be literally next door; the electronic window provides precisely the same view as would an actual glass window in the same spot. (Kirsh explains he had wanted a real window, but when quoted a price by the school he calculated it would be cheaper to put up the screens and cameras just to see through to the other side of the wall.)</p><p>In long technical papers, Kirsh and his students employ some of the language of anthropologists and computer scientists—<em>Scruffy</em> is a term from computer science, believe it or not—to analyze office “activity landscapes.” One of the key concepts in Kirsh’s research is that of the work <em>entry point.</em> What is it in your office environment that helps you figure out how to pick up where you left off or to begin a new task, when you’re interrupted, leave the office, switch tasks, or finish a task? “Neats,” he’s found, depend on a small number of “explicit coordinating structures” such as lists, day planners, and in-boxes to quickly and surely determine what to do next. Scruffies, on the other hand, are “data driven”—that is, they don’t explicitly plan out and specify what they do but instead rely on the office environment to give them clues and prompts, in the form of documents lying on the desk, files piled up on top of the filing cabinet, comments scribbled on envelopes, Post-it notes (which, surprisingly, many Neats disdain) stuck here and there, books left open on the floor, and so forth. It may seem wishful thinking to imagine that the environment is up to the task of keeping effective track of workflow in this way, and indeed, Kirsh says that Scruffies tend to at least slightly overestimate their ability to find things in the mess and to underestimate the occasional inefficiencies related to their disordered activity landscapes.</p><p>But Scruffies do tend to derive great advantage from the random prompts around them, noticing for example when a file they weren’t looking for proves helpful for the task at hand or suggests an even more useful task. Kirsh likens Scruffy task-opportunism to the shopper who goes to the store to buy lamb chops for dinner but ends up with a great piece of salmon that happens to be on sale. And he points out that there’s science to back up the notion that a messy environment is well suited to providing a stream of useful cues. <em>Descriptive complexity theory,</em> a branch of information science that characterizes the sorts of resources required to solve certain problems, dictates that the amount of information that can be represented in a system increases with the randomness of the system. This may seem counterintuitive, but it’s essentially a generalization of the idea that a messy room says more about its occupants than a neat one. With more things left out in the environment to be arranged in a greater variety of ways, there are more opportunities for gleaning information. An extremely neat office will always look the same, no matter what its occupant has been working on, while a messier office might reflect the occupant’s recent activities in a dozen different ways.</p><p>Kirsh doesn’t try to argue that Scruffies are necessarily more or less productive than Neats. Rather, he concludes that different workers tend to function best in differently ordered landscapes and thus it’s a mistake to try to force order on anyone. “People shape their environments over time until it conforms to the way they’re comfortable working, even if it seems out of control to someone else,” he says. “As soon as you start telling people how to do things, you’re customizing their environment for them, and that causes problems.” Not only will pushing Scruffies to get organized probably impair their productivity, he adds, but Scruffies will inevitably end up disorganized again anyway. “They’re recidivists,” he says.</p><p>Is the growing dependence on computers making the question of messy offices and desks increasingly irrelevant, as more information migrates to databases, word-processing documents, and the Web? Hardly. As numerous studies have pointed out, the production of paper documents tends to increase, rather than decrease, with computerization, as workers flock to the printer for hard copy. What’s more, computer files create a new potential mess, fraught with questions about how they should be named, formatted, grouped, stored, accessed, backed up, and protected, among others. The organizational powers that be often push for strict standards on these points, but others may find that such neatening efforts conflict with or restrict their practices and preferences, leading to tensions and technical problems. When the state information technology chief of Massachusetts announced in 2005 that the state was going to standardize its computer document format to be more compatible with open-source software—software that isn’t controlled by a company—than with Microsoft products, loud choruses of support and outrage ensued, closely followed by the announcement of an investigation into the chief’s apparently perfectly legal state-funded travel for participation in open-source software conferences, followed by a new state-government announcement that it would work with Microsoft to stay compatible with the company’s document formats, followed by an announcement from Microsoft that it would bring its document format closer to an open-source format. In the end, Governor Mitt Romney personally weighed in, concerned that the imbroglio might impinge on his presidential aspirations, or so it was rumored. And this was all over document <em>formatting.</em></p><p class="p3">But aside from the question of how groups of paper and digital documents are organized, it’s also worth noting that a typical digital document is generally in itself neater than a typical paper document. No smudges, no crinkles, no cross outs, and ready to spell-check, justify, paginate, and reproduce perfectly in as many versions as could be desired. It sounds like a big improvement. But consider the discovery in 2005 of an unusually messy handwritten Beethoven manuscript of the <em>Grosse Fuge,</em> a find that had music experts swooning and that was sold at auction for $1.95 million, one of the largest sums ever paid for a music manuscript. The exceptional value of the document, as it turns out, was in the mess itself. From auction-house Sotheby’s description:</p><p class="ext1">It is written in brown and black ink, sometimes over pencil and includes later annotations in pencil and red crayon, some added as proof corrections, on ten-stave paper—the staves frequently extended into the margins by the composer. Written on various paper-types the manuscript shows the extent of Beethoven’s working and reworking and includes deletions, corrections, deep erasures (occasionally the paper is rubbed right through, leaving small holes), smudged alterations and several pages pasted over the original or affixed with sealing-wax. The passion and struggle of Beethoven’s working can be seen graphically: the higher and more intense the music, the larger the notes. As Beethoven pushes the music higher than ever written before, the ledger lines are pushed exponentially towards the upper edge of the paper. It is also evident that Beethoven tried passages out on the piano, or perhaps the desktop. On page 23 of the manuscript, there is a passage of Beethoven’s own fingering. It is touching to imagine the ailing and entirely deaf composer running over passages on the piano, music he could scarcely hear, but certainly feel in his fingers.</p><p class="spb">While the special value of messily handwritten documents might apply to historical creative works, could it possibly have a place in today’s office? Absolutely, says Glover Ferguson, a chief scientist at Accenture in Chicago. Ferguson studies ways of usefully imbuing various everyday objects with computer-chip intelligence, and he showed us one of his favorites: a fat, gray-black pen he uses to take notes at meetings. The pen has a tiny sensor at its tip that keeps track of where it is on the paper, so that it can in effect store an image of whatever it writes. It was designed to be used in the field by salespeople, medical practitioners, and others as a way of entering data without having to carry around a fragile and expensive computer, because whatever check marks or letters are written with it can later be converted to digital information, as if they had been typed in. But Ferguson carries it around for a different reason. He wants his words to be preserved in a digital document but also his messy scribbles, just the way he made them. “Every doodle, smudge, or squiggle is a hook on which I can hang memories of what happened in a meeting,” he says. “The crossed-out word reminds me of the big debate we had; the arrow reminds me of the steps that led to this important decision. When you end up with only a typed transcript of the notes, you lose all the context and subtleties, and that’s the good stuff.”</p><p>Actually, ordinary digital documents can have a lot of extra information. But it’s not the kind of information that’s likely to endear them to you. For example, some word-processing programs, and especially Microsoft Word, will hang on to previous versions of your work and even pieces of unrelated files. This extra text doesn’t normally show up on your screen, so you probably remain unaware of it, but someone you share a document with might know how to bring it up. In 2005, both the Democratic National Committee and the United Nations circulated documents that proved embarrassing when critics were able to glean from them information not intended for public consumption. And hidden information in a document from the California attorney general condemning file-sharing software revealed that a movie-industry trade group had helped write it. All of these parties, no doubt, would have happily traded the neatness of digital documents for a few scribbles and coffee stains.</p><p>Being too neat with business documents can even present a public menace. When the brakes on all twenty of Amtrak’s high-speed Acela trains in the Northeast were found to contain cracks that could have led to a crash, forcing a three-month sidelining of the trains, the problem was eventually traced to an effort to declutter a maintenance manual. The original manual had pointed out the need to inspect the brakes for signs of impending cracks, but Amtrak wanted to put a more concise version in the hands of its maintenance people. Among the snippets cut for the neater, shorter version was the brake inspection warning.</p><p class="h1">Messy Organizational Structure</p><p class="p1">Is it a bad idea for companies to grow? That may often be the case in our world of increasingly fast-changing customer interests and demands, asserts Peter Nijkamp, an economics professor at the Free University of Amsterdam who studies the impact of technological change on business. The problem is that company growth typically leads to what Nijkamp calls <em>path dependency</em>—that is, a tendency to become locked into a particular way of doing things. “A dynamic market penalizes companies for path dependency,” he says. “And that makes creating larger organizations risky.”</p><p>Though perhaps the problem isn’t growth itself, suggests Nijkamp, but the way companies grow. When they become larger, they tend to gravitate to neater, more formal organizational structures and policies geared to push employees to work in neat, efficient synchrony toward common goals. But these very structures are what provide all the friction when it comes to rapid change. The ever-popular “six sigma” philosophy, for example, under the spell of which companies continuously and formally analyze all their processes with an eye to approaching perfection, is obviously not conducive to quickly throwing together a new business unit to rush out a product for a market that springs up overnight and that may disappear as quickly. Merely deciding to attack a new market can be a torturously prolonged process in larger companies. And sometimes, ironically enough, the fault lies largely with postmodern, network-style organizational schemes that companies have embraced as less-restrictive antidotes to the classic pyramidal hierarchy. In these newer schemes, the lines of reporting can become comically complex, to the point that it becomes unclear if anyone is really in a position to make a decision. IBM, for example, in the 1990s adopted a management structure that took the form of an eight-dimensional matrix, whose working presumably would have been perfectly transparent to anyone conversant in string theory. And companies keep taking on new, ambitious organizational schemes as they grow, partly out of fear of the alternative—that the organization will behave in unpredictable, uneven, uncoordinated, messy ways—and partly because they provide senior management with a sense of real accomplishment. Adding to the drive toward new, more ordered schemes is the observation that corporate performance invariably gets a temporary boost from them, thanks to a sort of organizational placebo effect. It’s an offshoot of the Hawthorne effect, mentioned in chapter 3—the principle that almost any purposeful change in a work environment tends to be temporarily effective. But the fact is, almost any highly ordered organizational scheme is ultimately going to be a poor fit for the dramatic swelling and collapsing that characterizes most markets these days.</p><p>In contrast, consider Scientific Generics, located in Waltham, Massachusetts, and Cambridge, England. It’s a three-hundred-employee firm that has no real “main” line of business. The company provides some consulting services, but mostly looks for interesting unserved niches in any market, creates units to develop or acquire technology aimed at those niches, then does whatever seems most profitable with the technology: licenses it, builds a business unit around it, spins it off into its own company, partners with an established company, or just lets it die should demand wither or fail to materialize in the first place. Over the past seventeen years, Scientific Generics has created or partnered in some seventy companies and business units whose products range from display screens to toys to medical devices. Sometimes the new lines of business generate new lines of business. That’s what happened in 1998, when a business unit developing a sensor-equipped stylus for Palm-like handheld devices spawned a unit that developed position-tracking devices for automobiles. “Companies usually focus their R&amp;D [research and development] only on their existing strategic needs,” says Geoff Waite, the company’s vice president. “That makes them less idea-rich, and they miss opportunities.”</p><p>The basic thinking behind this more freewheeling sort of structure is to focus on new, “spin-up” business units that quickly pop into existence when an opportunity presents itself and then compete for resources within the company. If the spin-up thrives, it’s allowed to quickly expand without limit, pulling whatever it needs from other parts of the company, even if doing so hurts the rest of the company. If it doesn’t thrive, it’s quickly put out of its misery. It’s a different way of thinking about a company—not as a seamless whole, but as a fractured conglomeration of transitory, semi-independent units, some leaping into being and growing quickly, others withering away, with employees and funding flowing freely and fast between them. University of Milan researcher Mario Benassi refers to spin-up-friendly companies as “modular” companies, and espouses three basic principles for them: growing in pieces instead of holistically; being as quick to shrink or get rid of logy pieces of the company as to invest in the promising ones; and being prepared to reorient its efforts around any of the pieces. “Modular companies are more focused, and faster,” he says. “They can quickly get rid of activities they’re not interested in anymore.” Traditional companies, by contrast, tend to be so fixated on preserving the same core business that potentially hot new markets are poorly served—if they are served at all. As challenging as coming up with promising new spin-up ideas may be, the hardest part of the process may be to quickly close down those ideas that don’t show signs of panning out. Nijkamp says a company with a spin-up failure rate of 60 percent would be doing quite well, suggesting that the key is to keep a high churn rate. In that light, the spin-up concept starts to look a little less like brilliant business planning and a little more like trial and error.</p><p>You don’t have to be high-tech to take advantage of the spin-up concept. Smart fashion and sporting goods firms also whip up new, independent brands to surf the trend of the moment. Large advertising agencies typically comprise dozens of smaller ones that address various industry niches. And savvy restaurateurs like Stephen Starr in Philadelphia (Pod, Buddakan), or Danny Meyer in New York (Union Square Café, Gramercy Tavern), grow not by making individual restaurants bigger, nor by opening clones of the same restaurant, but by creating entirely new concepts to add to their strings of properties, occasionally closing or reinventing existing ones when their cachet fades.</p><p class="h1">Messy Innovation</p><p class="p1">Half-Life 2, the blockbuster computer game from Valve Software in Bellevue, Washington, first became available over the Internet in late 2003. Valve hadn’t actually released the game—the code had been stolen by hackers, who posted it for free downloading. Online piracy has become fairly routine, of course. But what happened next wasn’t: Valve customers worldwide got to work hunting down the thieves. Why would a bunch of online gamers, notorious for disrespecting niceties like copyrights, go after the glorious liberators of the program they had so eagerly awaited?</p><p>The answer has to do with where some companies are now turning for innovation. Thanks to globalization, the search for creative solutions may be the most important issue facing U.S. businesses today, insists David Audretsch, director of the Institute for Development Strategies at Indiana University, and author of <em>The Entrepreneurial Society.</em> China alone has mustered a vast trove of capital investment and cheap labor it is skillfully wielding to undercut U.S. manufacturers of everything from socks to electronic chips, and service firms are under attack as well. “You’re not going to be able to compete on price,” says Audretsch. “You’re going to have to live off of having a new idea that other companies around the globe don’t have.” A company that’s just taking care of business, doing all the things that used to guarantee success—providing high-quality products backed by great service, marketing with flair, holding costs down, and carefully managing cash flow—is at risk of being flattened if it isn’t also an innovation engine in the style of a computer or nanotechnology company.</p><p>So where are all the bright ideas supposed to come from? Holding companies back has been a rigid approach to innovation based on a classic, neat division of labor in which R&amp;D is carried out by scientists and engineers in the labs of high-tech companies. What we need now, says Audretsch, is a messier concept of innovation that enables any company to tease it out of any employee, as well as from external stores of expertise such as boards of directors, venture capital firms, suppliers, and partners. Consider a company called Three Rivers in Mesa, Arizona, which markets wheelchairs with easier-to-turn wheel rims, a hand-powered exercycle that controls video games, and other innovative products for the disabled. Like most smaller companies with a modest staff—Three Rivers has six full-time employees—the firm can’t afford to hire dedicated researchers. So the four-year-old company scours university research labs specializing in “human engineering” to dig up ideas it can license. “Our expertise is in deciding if there’s a market for a new type of product, and in taking a lab prototype and developing it into a marketable, manufacturable version,” says cofounder and president Ron Boninger. He adds that Three Rivers contracts all its production to outside manufacturing firms—and cajoles them into coming up with not only manufacturing innovations but also suggested design changes to make products more reliable and cheaper to produce. One manufacturing supplier, for example, figured out a way to make oval aluminum wheelchair wheel rims by squeezing heated aluminum out an oval hole like toothpaste instead of the far more expensive molding process other manufacturers offered.</p><p>One of the best sources of innovation for companies may be the one that’s furthest from traditional, engineering-lab-driven R&amp;D: customers. The computer gaming community has been a leader in this regard. Take Valve, for example. Not long after the company opened shop in 1996, managers noticed that a number of skilled enthusiasts had hacked into the shoot-’em-up game’s code and created modified versions with more exotic settings and weapons. At first appalled, the managers quickly realized that the customized games were winning new fans, so they provided new software that made it easier for fans to go to town on “mods.” One extensive mod became so popular that the company “in-housed”—hired—the modder and spun off the new version as a separate product. “Having people constantly adding to the product extends its life and fills out all kinds of market niches that the original product wouldn’t have reached,” says Lars Bo Jeppesen, a researcher at the Copenhagen Business School in Sweden who has studied how customers contribute to products at Valve and other software companies.</p><p>But it’s not just software companies that can usefully blur the line between customers and employees. Take Van’s Aircraft, an Aurora, Oregon, manufacturer of small, personal airplanes that are shipped as kits to be assembled in customers’ garages. A thriving community of Van’s enthusiasts, meeting online as well as at “fly-in” gatherings, collaborates on and swaps designs for plane modifications and accessories, ranging from alternative engines to cockpit sunshades. The five top managers at Van’s spend a combined twenty-five hours a week online checking out customers’ doings, says general manager Scott Risen, along with untold hours at fly-ins to get a firsthand look at some of the innovations. The best ones are incorporated into the planes or offered through the company’s catalog of accessories. “We offer all kinds of items designed by customers,” says Risen. “If we see something we like in an airplane, we find out who made it and ask them if they’d let us market it.” The company is flexible about the arrangement, offering either to buy the rights to the innovation outright or to serve as a distributor for a commission. One popular recent addition to the catalog, for example, is an electronic switch that performs a previously cumbersome adjustment to wing flaps with just a touch of a button; a customer makes the device and Van’s takes orders for it.</p><p>Some types of products readily lend themselves to customer input by virtue of a sharing-oriented community whose members are quick to roll up their sleeves, notes Sonali Shah, a University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign business school professor who studies innovation in user communities. Windsurfers, in-line skaters, and skateboarders have been inventing and driving the evolution of new products for many years, she notes, initially sharing their ideas with each other and with companies through events and magazines and more recently online. “Car tuners,” who rig up small cars with exotic gadgets to extract spine-snapping performance, feed ideas via the Internet to the thousands of companies that make aftermarket components and inspire the major manufacturers: Ford and Honda have brought out versions of their Focus and Civic models, respectively, that incorporate modifications pioneered by tuners. And even disease sufferers are banding together on the Web to shoulder some drug-company responsibilities: when the Food and Drug Administration forced GlaxoSmithKline to take a drug for irritable bowel syndrome off the market because of side effect risks, an online community of IBS patients successfully lobbied the FDA to reconsider.</p><p>Getting an online community of customers to shoulder some of the work for a company is often as easy as asking. That’s all Valve had to do. It posted a message on its Web site asking fans to help catch the code thieves, and hundreds got to work. It may seem unlikely that customers are eager to take on tasks for which even well-paid employees may not always show great enthusiasm, but that’s the big surprise revealed by the community-driven, rather than company-driven, world of open-source software: what might be drudge work to an employee will be a thrilling challenge to some civilian out there. “Companies spent the ’90s in a race for talent, and paid whatever it took to retain the best people, but never ended up getting most of their energy,” says Steven Weber, a University of California at Berkeley professor researching how open-source principles apply to businesses and government. “Open-source projects get about twice as much energy from people.” After all, how many automobile engineers would be honored to be charged with developing a better cup holder? But customers sick of cleaning spilled coffee would line up for the job, asserts Weber. They certainly don’t hesitate to take on jobs like providing technical support to one another—one of the main activities of many online communities.</p><p>Teasing out innovations from customers may only require providing them with the right tools and instruction. Statistics software vendor StataCorp in College Station, Texas, for example, gives customers the software needed to create new types of statistics reports and then makes the new versions available to other customers. Anvil Cases, a City of Industry, California, manufacturer of highly protective shipping cases, provides customers with detailed directions and diagrams for designing a case’s interior to fit the complex shape of a particular video monitor, say, or musical instrument. The company then hangs on to the designs to make cases for future customers with the same monitor or instrument.</p><p>As is often true with messier approaches, coordination and goal setting present challenges. Customers may help out a company, but that doesn’t mean they can be ordered around like employees. For one thing, managers have to appeal to customers’ internal motivations instead of simply telling them what to do. “To get productivity from them, you have to give up control,” says Eric Raymond, president of the Open Source Initiative, and widely considered one of the leaders of the open-source movement. Other requirements for managing nonemployee contributors, adds Raymond, include being quick to respond openly and honestly to questions and setting up a means for giving public recognition of their efforts. “People will go through astonishing amounts of effort to get that reward,” he says. Ironically, the ultimate reward is often that of offering a job—some customer-contributors are motivated by the notion that their effort might be treated as a sort of audition. Like Valve, Van’s Aircraft has “in-housed” talented customers. Not that customers can be expected to provide an unbroken stream of great ideas. Most ideas won’t be useful, says Shah, and it will be up to managers to separate the grains of wheat from the piles of chaff. “Companies that can recognize which customer innovations are the ones that the market needs will have a real competitive advantage,” she explains.</p><p>And companies that have won the loyalty of an online customer detective force—well, they’ll do even better. As Valve’s director of marketing Doug Lombardi explains, the hackers who stole Half-Life 2 were tracked down by the game’s fans and arrested six months after the company asked for help. “This game had been in development for five years and cost us tens of millions of dollars,” Lombardi says. “It was nice to have the help.”</p><p class="h1">Messy Information Systems</p><p class="p1">In 2004, the FBI abandoned work on a computer system on which it had spent more than $150 million over a five-year period. In the ensuing finger-pointing over the derailed system, which was supposed to allow agents to share information about cases with each other and with other agencies, congresspeople lined up to declare they were shocked—shocked!—to learn that this much money could be wasted on a project that didn’t do the job. They had forgotten, apparently, that the Federal Aviation Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, and every branch of the military, among many other federal entities, have lost far more on big, dead-end technology projects.</p><p>It’s tempting to pass off such costly mishaps to the inability of lumbering, bureaucratic government agencies to manage projects, but the fact is, having a money-devouring information system go feet up is more the rule than the exception at almost any sort of organization—it just doesn’t get the press if it’s a private company’s blunder. “More than half the large, custom systems that are started never reach users,” says Joseph Goguen, a computer science researcher (and colleague of David Kirsh) at the University of California at San Diego. “Usually they’re just canceled, but sometimes they’re declared a success and then not used.” Even small and midsized businesses build these clunkers by the tens of thousands, he adds—and often blow a larger percentage of revenues on them to boot.</p><p>To an outsider, runaway computer projects may smack of incompetence on the part of the project’s managers. But even companies with gilded technology reputations get pulled into mammoth failures—IBM, for example, was accused in the mid-1990s of helping burn $1.5 billion of taxpayer funds in a futile effort to revamp the nation’s air traffic control systems. And indeed, Goguen notes that when experts studied the costs of fixing failed computer projects, they found that only about 20 percent of the costs were related to problems with programming or system design. Another 20 percent or so was related to the project’s failure to address the needs the organization had stated. But about 60 percent of the costs went into the real culprit: the organization’s failure to figure out what its people really needed from the project. “The developers end up designing and building the wrong system,” says Goguen, “and they don’t realize it until they’re almost through.”</p><p>You might have thought that taking into account what people want from a computer system is the easy part, rather than the killer. The problem is that computer systems are usually highly ordered, relatively inflexible entities that must be worked with in specific ways. People, on the other hand, tend to work in a variety of less predictable ways. Sometimes these messier work styles are simply ignored by the people who build information systems, under the assumption that if a system is potentially useful enough, people will adapt themselves to it—a terrible assumption, as it turns out. In other cases, user work styles are investigated but ultimately misunderstood by the computer specialists who do the investigating. Either way, the result is essentially a mismatch between the way computer systems are organized and how people are organized.</p><p>Taking a less ordered approach to building computer systems can help. For example, information technology projects often begin with interviews of managers and potential users of the new system—an obvious first move for the well-organized system builder. But Justin Hectus, a director of information for Los Angeles–based law firm Keesal, Young &amp; Logan, points out that a funny thing happens when you ask people point-blank about the way they work. They get it all wrong. People tend to be unaware of the eccentric ways in which they organize their own work processes, he says, and make all kinds of poor guesses about how a computer system would best help them. To get it right, Hectus and his staff become office ethnographers, unobtrusively shadowing managers and other employees for days on end to observe firsthand how people work until they’ve obtained a feeling for the needs of those who will be dependent on the system. “We spend significantly more time studying how people work than we do on the actual programming and development,” he notes. One behavior his group observed among the company’s eighty lawyers and paralegals, for example, was the frequent frantic effort to try to enlist someone—anyone—in the firm to help out with a sudden, overwhelming influx of tasks. Realizing that lawyers had tremendously irregular workloads and no good way of smoothing out the spikes, Hectus’s department put together a system that lets everyone in the firm keep track of everyone else’s workload via mobile device, so that a lawyer who’s swamped in court can see at a glance who in the firm is experiencing a lull and may be available to help out for a few hours or days. It was a system that no one had specifically asked for but that everyone was glad to have.</p><p>A related problem, says the University of California’s Goguen, is that people will often state with great confidence what they want from a system, until they actually see the results, at which point they change their minds. The trick, he says, is to find a faster, cheaper, and messier way to uncover that sort of mind changing, rather than going through a long, complex, orderly system-development process to reach the same point. When Goguen’s students took on the task of developing an online system for a local jazz festival, for example, he had them sit down representative users in front of a cardboard box on which handwritten pages were taped, providing a zero-cost simulation of a first iteration of the system. One of the several discoveries that came out of the sessions was that the jazz fans, who tend to be older, preferred easier-to-read large type on the “screen”—a simple change that if left undiscovered would have required redesigning the entire Web site.</p><p>But even when systems developers do a good job of figuring out exactly what users really do need and want from a system, projects can still fail. The problem, notes Danny Shader, founder and CEO of mobile applications provider Good Technology in Santa Clara, California, is that companies operate in a disordered, fast-changing business environment. As a result, firms sometimes end up with systems designed to meet their now-outdated needs of eighteen months ago. “If you give a developer a snapshot of your business to work with, you’re going to have a problem,” says Shader. The solution, he explains, is to assume that systems, no matter how they’re designed, are going to fail to meet users’ needs in some ways, and to build into them the capacity for frequent and extensive modification. Such messy systems may not initially perform as many functions as a rigidly designed system, but in the end they’ll prove far more useful.</p><p>Contracts need to be messier, too. Organizations frequently turn to consulting firms for major computer projects, enlisting long contracts that spell out in great detail exactly what is supposed to be delivered at the end of the project. That simply forces the consulting firm to drive single-mindedly toward those specifications, without necessarily having much regard for how users will appreciate the results when it’s all over. Instead, some firms are starting to offer an “optional scope” contract that is actually a conglomeration of flexible minicontracts, each one of which covers the work for a few months or other limited period of time. At the end of each period, the client has the option to activate the minicontract for the next period of time, to walk away from the entire remaining deal, or to renegotiate the next minicontract based on problems with the intermediate results or changes in the organization’s needs. In a sense, the contract is being written on the fly. That encourages everyone to watch out for and correct brewing mismatches on an ongoing basis and allows them to cut short losses if things are going far wrong. Of course, doing so may very well throw a number of monkey wrenches into the normally orderly development process and make for a lot of zigging and zagging, and may even add costs, delay deadlines, and limit functionality compared to the original specifications. But it probably beats having to listen to a bunch of congresspeople expressing outrage at your well-organized incompetence.</p></div></body></html>
