Now a successful CEO, Rutan’s job in the late 1960s found him in an F-4 Phantom jet fighter that was tumbling to the ground. Never before had an out-of-control F-4 avoided crashing, but this time, thanks in part to Rutan’s skill, the plane recovered. Rutan wasn’t a fighter jock; he was an engineer who had been asked to figure out why the treacherous aircraft was flying pilots into the ground in Vietnam. While his fellow engineers attacked such tasks with calculators, Rutan insisted on considering the problem in the air. The near-fatal experience not only led to a critical F-4 modification, it also confirmed for Rutan a notion he had held ever since he had built model airplanes as a child. The way to make a better aircraft wasn’t to sit around perfecting a design, it was to get something up in the air and see what happens, then try to fix whatever goes wrong.</p><p>Despite what happened in the F-4, that policy isn’t as dangerous as it sounds. There are plenty of ways to test a suspect aircraft without risking life and limb—like lashing the wing or tail of the aircraft to a truck and driving it at high speed down a highway to get a feel for how it behaves, a technique Rutan mastered in the early 1970s when he started his own company designing cutting-edge experimental aircraft for amateur builders and pilots. Not that Rutan is afraid to wrap his hand around the control stick of a finicky plane; he had his pilot’s license before his driver’s license. Rutan is sort of an action nerd, and even today, at sixty-three, he cuts a figure that is somehow both dashing and just a little bit goofy—part Evel Knievel with even bigger sideburns, part Bill Gates with a slight drawl and leather jacket. In 1982, Rutan founded an aircraft design and prototyping company called Scaled Composites, which now sprawls through a village of corrugated-metal buildings in a windblown patch of desert in Mojave, eighty miles northeast of Los Angeles.</p><p>What are Rutan’s management rules for keeping the firm on track? He insists he doesn’t have any. “I don’t like rules,” he says. “Things are so easy to change if you don’t write them down.” Rutan feels good management works in much the same way good aircraft design does: instead of trying to figure out the best way to do something and sticking to it, just try out an approach, and keep fixing it. He does allow, however, that he’s evolved a few rough, guiding principles for his company. One is not to worry so much about the formal background of the engineers he hires or to look for the sorts of specialists normally sought after by aerospace companies. Instead, he looks for people who share his passion for aircraft design and who can work on anything from a fuselage to a door handle or are willing to learn how. He then gives those people free rein.</p><p>Another Rutan principle is that it’s useful to have everyone questioning everything the company does all the time, and especially to have people questioning their own work. Rutan makes sure that when employees point out their mistakes, they’re applauded rather than reprimanded.</p><p>A principle he applies to himself is to avoid spending a lot of time running the company. He long ago trained his board of directors not to waste time asking administrative or financial questions he can’t or won’t answer. An eight-person management committee, of which he is a member, guides the firm. But Rutan mostly keeps busy by picking out the one or two projects that interest him—there are usually a dozen or so going on at any one time—and joining those teams as a designer.</p><p>Downplaying up-front design, not matching employees’ tasks to their experience and training, eschewing specialization, creating a culture that glorifies questions and mistakes, refusing to act like a CEO—how has all this worked out for Rutan? The one-hundred-employee Scaled Composites managed eighty-eight consecutive profitable quarters in an industry that is perennially profit challenged. The firm’s regular clients include NASA and most of the big aerospace companies, and it is known as the go-to concern when a need arises for an aircraft that flies higher or faster or farther or more nimbly or less expensively than any other has. Scaled Composites has never lost a test pilot and has rolled out twenty-six new types of aircraft in thirty years, at a time when giant aerospace companies struggle to get a single new aircraft out in a decade.</p><p>Rutan’s unwillingness to stick with rules, overplan, constrain employees, or do anything the way it was done before served Scaled Composites especially well when the company set out to design and build the first private-sector, reusable spacecraft. In 2004, Scaled’s <em>SpaceShipOne,</em> boasting an almost outrageously novel design that includes rotating wings and a rocket engine running on rubber and laughing gas, safely flew more than one hundred kilometers up into the edge of space and back twice in a week. That feat earned Rutan’s team the $10 million Ansari X-Prize, and the job of creating a five-passenger space vehicle for Virgin Galactic, the company set up by Virgin Atlantic Airways’ founder Richard Branson to carry paying passengers into space. Scaled Composites will remain in control of the project because, in Rutan’s words, “It’s way too risky to turn this technology over to another group and let them manufacture and operate it.” He’s simply seen too many aircraft companies sink projects under the weight of rules, planning, routine, and oversight.</p><p class="spb">It’s easy to assume that it takes a strong manager to run an orderly company and a weak one to let a company become somewhat messy and disorganized. And it’s true that a manager who’s unwilling or unable to provide guidance, inspiration, or other forms of leadership is likely to see her organization devolve into unproductive disorder. But as we’ve seen, organizations can be messy in highly useful ways. And some managers are adept at cultivating this sort of productive disorder, though it hardly stems from weakness. Let’s take a look at some of the ways in which managers have profitably allowed various types of disorder to slip into their organizations.</p><p class="h1">Patient Mess</p><p class="p1">A manager who recognizes an opportunity to apply a usefully messier touch to an ordered organization can face skepticism from employees, directors, and customers. In that situation, starting with just a piece of the organization rather than the whole can help lower the perceived risk and provide a proof of concept that paves the way for broader changes.</p><p>Patrick Charmel, the forty-four-year-old CEO of Griffin Hospital in Derby, Connecticut, has recognized the effectiveness of that approach. For the better part of a decade, the community hospital had been losing patients to hospitals in more affluent communities. Finally, the Griffin board of directors decided to invest in building a new obstetrics wing. Charmel and his management team commissioned a survey of women who had recently given birth, asking them what they would like to see in an obstetrics unit. The answers came in: Mothers wanted not only their husbands in the room during delivery, but also their children and their own parents. They wanted rooms that didn’t look like hospital rooms. They wanted double beds, so their husbands—or whoever—could sleep next to them. They wanted Jacuzzis. They wanted big windows and skylights. They wanted large, comfortable lounges where the family could gather at all hours. They wanted nurses who constantly paid close attention to them and doctors who always followed up on problems.</p><p>A bit taken aback by the colorful and daunting list of requests, the rangy, soft-spoken but direct Charmel decided to see which of these sorts of needs were being met by the competition. He had one of the hospital’s female managers stuff a pillow under her dress, and the two of them visited every obstetrics and maternity ward within an hour’s drive, posing as expectant parents who wanted to tour the facilities. The rest of the management team researched obstetrics wings around the country. The answer: no hospital they could find addressed these sorts of requests. Charmel decided Griffin would come as close as it reasonably could to responding to the wish list that had come up in the survey.</p><p>The first step, presumably, would be to heavily winnow down and prioritize the list. Some of the ideas, like allowing children in delivery rooms, seemed goofy. Some, like skylights, seemed frivolous. Some, like Jacuzzis, seemed downright dangerous, since it is widely known that bathing during labor carries a risk of infection. As for double-size hospital beds—well, they didn’t even exist. And how was the hospital supposed to change the behavior of doctors and nurses, who tend to be fiercely protective of their routines? It’s one thing to give hardware shoppers the sort of messy completeness they’re looking for; it’s quite another in a hospital. Besides, prioritizing and focusing are basic functions of senior management. Funds, time, skills, and other resources are in limited supply, but ways in which they can be spent are not. Prioritizing is one of a manager’s primary means for imposing order on a large, messy universe of demands.</p><p>Which is why Griffin’s board was shocked to hear Charmel argue for skipping the winnowing, focusing, and prioritizing, and, instead, just going ahead and doing everything on the list. “We asked them what they wanted, and they told us,” Charmel said of the mothers. “Now let’s just give it to them.” The board reluctantly said okay, though Charmel wouldn’t be allowed to spend more per square foot than other hospitals spent on average on their facilities in the state.</p><p>The new obstetrics and maternity unit had rooms where families could gather. It had skylights. It had a Jacuzzi. (Research revealed that the concern over infection while bathing during labor was a myth.) It had custom-built double beds. It had birthing-helper classes for children and grandparents. And it had “primary-care nursing”—each patient was the responsibility of a single nurse who would make sure that all of the patient’s needs were met and that the doctors were taking care of business. The wing came in on budget, thanks to heavy leaning on contractors and suppliers, and creative corner cutting that included buying some of the furniture on sale at local discount stores. More important, patient response was immediate and enthusiastic. But some of the nurses complained to Charmel about the loss of routine and order in the wing. Swarms of families and friends were using the communal rooms for pizza parties or late-night card games. “Excellent,” replied Charmel. “That’s what the room is there for.” Husbands were showing up after working late shifts and climbing into the double beds with their wives, waking up mother and baby. “What’s going to happen when we discharge her tomorrow?” reasoned Charmel. “He’s going to come home from the late shift and wake up his wife and baby. As long as they’re not complaining, we might as well let them get used to it here.” Many of the nurses and obstetricians grumbled about the new, unconstrained patient demands on their time and attention, and some left. But as word of the strange new wing got out into the medical community, top-notch obstetricians, including younger doctors and female doctors often favored by expectant mothers, started actively seeking out Griffin. Obstetrics admissions doubled.</p><p>“Can we build an entire hospital like this?” Charmel asked the senior management team.</p><p>The surveys went out, and the list of demands came rolling in. Patients wanted nice furniture. They wanted full kitchens. They wanted carpeting. They wanted nurses near their beds essentially all the time—elderly patients often press the call button not because anything is wrong but to make sure someone is out there, just in case. They wanted unlimited visits at any time from anyone and everyone. They wanted their pets to visit. They wanted fish tanks. They wanted spouses or family members to have beds so they could sleep right there in the room with them and help take care of them. They didn’t want to get lost in the halls. They wanted double rooms so they wouldn’t be alone, while at the same time wanting privacy. And they wanted a better understanding of what was happening to them medically. Once again, Charmel pushed for doing it all, no exceptions.</p><p>Today, visitors to Griffin Hospital are greeted in the lobby and escorted by a staff member to make sure they don’t get lost; signs and pointing are banned. The corridors are carpeted; special wheel bearings were brought in to keep gurneys from bogging down in the thick pile. L-shaped double rooms were custom designed to keep each patient out of sight of the other for privacy while affording both a window view. Some are “care partner” rooms, in which family members who help provide care are allowed to stay with the patient on couches that fold out into double beds. Nurse workstations are scattered around instead of centralized so that every patient can look out from his or her bed and see a nurse sitting some fifteen feet away. No room is more than one hundred feet from a well-stocked, home-style kitchen, open to all patients and visitors twenty-four hours a day, where muffins are frequently baking. Patients are encouraged to look over their charts, as well as literature about their illnesses, and are asked to take part in a detailed “case conference” with doctors and nurses the day after admission. For those who want to learn even more, a lay-oriented medical library is open for patients to browse and study, often alongside doctors leafing through medical journals. The hospital couldn’t get health clearance for patients’ pets, so it brought in specially groomed and trained dogs to make rounds. The fish tank in the psychiatric ward is made of bulletproof glass to satisfy security regulations.</p><p>Patient satisfaction soared to 96 percent, a level virtually unheard of in the hospital business, and admissions have risen an average of 2 percent a year. Griffin’s no-prioritizing, no-winnowing approach has become a product in its own right. Some forty hospitals a year each pay Griffin $3,000 to give administrators and caregivers tours of the facility, and more than one hundred hospitals pay $15,000 a year to become members of Planetree, a Griffin-owned organization that helps hospitals duplicate the Griffin model. Not a bad result for scaling up the benefits from a single wing to a whole hospital’s worth of messy management.</p><p class="h1">Hacking out a Compromise</p><p class="p1">As with human couples, a union between neater and messier organizations can lead to tensions. It takes skilled managers to work out the sorts of compromises that can preserve much of the messier organization’s useful disorder while avoiding dysfunctional clashes—and ideally help the neater organization open up to at least a little disorder.</p><p>It would be hard to find a more improbable candidate for the job of mess ambassador to orderly companies than Miguel de Icaza. In the early 1990s, de Icaza was a long-haired, boisterous undergraduate at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, where he stumbled on computer bulletin boards used by programmers in the open-source software movement—the approach to software development that hinges on free distribution by a loose confederation of independent programmers scattered around the planet who communicate via the Internet. De Icaza quickly made a name for himself in the open-source community writing deft, useful programs such as spreadsheets, as well as by hacking into the heart of Mexico’s largest supercomputer to demonstrate its vulnerability. After blowing a job interview at Microsoft in 1996 by lecturing managers there on why open-source software is better than Microsoft’s, de Icaza enlisted hundreds of volunteer open-source programmers around the world to join him in writing GNOME, a program that layered a Microsoft Windows–like, easy-to-use graphical interface over the arcane commands previously needed to use open-source software. A critical step toward bringing open-source software to the masses, GNOME was an enormous hit, adopted by tens of thousands of users as well as by Hewlett-Packard, Novell, Red Hat, Sun Microsystems, and several other mainstream software companies that compete with Microsoft and its hugely dominant Windows software.</p><p>In 1999, de Icaza and a friend founded a company called Ximian, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to develop more open-source programs and to get paid by companies for customizing and supporting the software. Then in 2000, de Icaza was struck by a vision—on a box of cornflakes. The box offered a free computer game that, like most software in the world, ran only on Windows. There was no denying it: as long as Windows remained so dominant, most programmers would write their programs to run on it instead of writing open-source software, further perpetuating Windows’ dominance. What would level the playing field, de Icaza realized, was a set of programming tools that would let programmers write software for both Windows-based and open-source-based computers. Backed by $15 million in venture capital, de Icaza set Ximian and programmers around the world to work on the project straightaway, calling it <em>Mono,</em> Spanish for “monkey.”</p><p>In 2002, Brady Anderson was a top programming manager and a sixteen-year veteran at Utah-based software manufacturer Novell, a large, old-line, Windows-based software company whose moribund product line had been losing more than a tenth of its business every year. Novell executives thought one way to stanch the flow might be to partner with hot young open-source software companies, so it dispatched Anderson to the slushy streets of Cambridge to check out Ximian. When Anderson entered the Ximian office, he saw little to encourage him. It looked more like a dorm than a place of business—a messy playground for water-pistol duels between young hippies over which a large, inflatable moose head presided. It was a far cry from Novell’s hushed maze of cubicles, where interaction meant a meeting in a conference room at 9:00 a.m. sharp.</p><p>The picture seemed even less promising when Anderson laid eyes on de Icaza, a boyish, T-shirted fellow, rail thin in a way that suggested either extraordinary aerobic fitness or nutritional obliviousness. But de Icaza quickly proved an agreeable host—mellow, chatty, amiably confident, and surprisingly noneccentric. He articulated his plans and ambitions for Mono with something akin to religious fervor, and Anderson, to his own surprise, found himself agreeing with everything de Icaza said. “From that conversation, I decided we’d do most of our development work in Mono,” Anderson says. He returned to Utah and told other Novell executives he had seen and heard the future of their company. Meanwhile, de Icaza, who had previously rebuffed several other large companies that had come courting because he doubted their commitment to open-source software, told his Ximian colleagues that he had sensed a kindred spirit in Anderson. The next year Ximian became part of Novell.</p><p>But how would Novell, a company long accustomed to developing software with tightly organized groups of employees in neighboring cubicles, mesh its operations with a company that relied on a loose band of maverick in-house hackers who did their best work at 2:00 a.m. and communicated mostly online and a few hundred volunteer programmers around the world who did whatever they wanted to whenever they felt like it?</p><p>De Icaza knew that, for starters, Ximian would have to neaten up some. “To integrate the companies, we had to let go of our culture of independence,” he says. Ximian and its forty employees agreed to move into new, more buttoned-down offices in Cambridge with—shudder—cubicles and conference rooms, though at least the moose head made the trip, too. De Icaza was used to coming in at noon to start work, but now he gamely staggered in for early-morning meetings. With Novell employees on the team and to keep Novell investors apprised of progress, project schedules had to be more clearly defined and responsibilities more tightly delineated. “Now one of my motivations is that I’m being paid to do this, and I have to deliver products,” de Icaza says. On the other hand, he still has been able to hang on to many of his less-ordered management techniques. He relies on a crew scattered around the world, managed almost entirely through online communications. He hires not through résumés or interviews but by offering jobs to open-source contributors whose online work he admires. And he still usually works noon through the small hours of the morning when an absence of early meetings allows, and lets others at Ximian keep the routines that work best for them.</p><p>Meanwhile, Anderson was determined to bring some of de Icaza’s high-bounce, messy style to Novell’s staid culture. He repeatedly brought de Icaza out to Novell’s headquarters in Provo, where de Icaza was encouraged to walk around and spread the gospel of open-source attitudes. Matt Asay, a business office director at Novell, concedes it took people a while to get used to “this Bohemian invader,” as he refers to de Icaza. “People were uncomfortable at first, they didn’t like it,” he says. But changes started to take hold. Anderson’s programmers, who had always worked out project details in conference rooms or over the walls between adjoining cubicles, gradually became comfortable posting their work online day to day and letting programmers they had never met take shots at it over the Internet. Instead of standardizing a single method to solving a software problem, Novell programmers learned to tolerate the messiness of multiple approaches among project programmers. “If there are three different ways of getting something done, Miguel won’t take a stand,” Anderson says. “It’s not efficient, but if you tell someone they can’t do it their way, they’ll probably drop out.”</p><p>Novell has since thrown itself completely into open-source programming. In 2004, the company even shifted its corporate headquarters from Provo to Waltham, Massachusetts, twenty minutes from Ximian. The changes saw the company’s stock price double from its level before the Ximian acquisition. Novell has more recently had some down quarters, not because of having slipped into the open-source camp, but in large part because so many other companies have been following its lead. Within eight months of Novell’s announcement of its new open-source commitment, three of the largest players in the computer industry—IBM, Sun, and, of all companies, Microsoft—announced the transfer of significant chunks of their respective product lines to the open-source world.</p><p>De Icaza’s and Anderson’s efforts to fuse the messy world of renegade programming with the highly ordered one of cubicle-rat software development may have helped set the future of computing for years to come.</p><p class="h1">Cooking up a Mess</p><p class="p1">Entrepreneurs who create companies from scratch have a distinct advantage when it comes to building in disorder. They needn’t overcome the inertia of entrenched processes, employees used to doing things a certain way, or a sea of investors of which some subset will always object to the risks of straying from the planned, consistent, and orderly. If an entrepreneur can come up with a helpfully disordered approach to some aspect of the business, there’s simply less friction to keep her from implementing it.</p><p>Disorder is not the first thing to come to mind when one enters the stately art deco building across from Manhattan’s Madison Square Park that houses the restaurant Tabla. But things start to get mildly and interestingly mixed up inside the restaurant, thanks to a decor that genteelly blends wood, mosaics, and metal in swooping architectural forms, simultaneously suggesting the exotic and the familiar. This mix turns out to hint at the blur in the menu, which features standards of upscale Western cuisine, such as lobster, veal, and bass, filtered through a mesh of Indian-and-otherwise-Asian-accented treatments, ranging from coriander-and-coconut curry to lotus roots and green cardamom. The blending of styles seems to work: a $75 prix-fixe charge has not deterred crowds at Tabla, and this in a city where Indian food is heavily associated with $10 meals in Second Avenue joints. There’s no restaurant like it in New York City.</p><p>Which is actually a little odd in and of itself, considering that Tabla is technically part of a chain of eight New York City eateries in the Union Square Hospitality Group, founded and run by restaurateur Danny Meyer. None of the restaurants has any visible connection to the others in terms of decor or menu. One is a burger-and-shake stand, one a high-cuisine classic, one a jazz club, one a museum café, and so on. Other restaurant owners can rightfully boast if just one of their restaurants survives five years in New York’s viciously competitive eating scene. But Meyer has not only kept all of his restaurants afloat, he has seen four of them make it onto the Zagat Survey’s list of top ten restaurants in New York.</p><p>There is a link between the diversity among the restaurants in the Union Square Group and their success. If other restaurant groups don’t outright clone their eateries, they at least generally work off a theme, such as following the latest trend in food, or sticking with high-end nouvelle style, or pitching at families. Meyer’s model for how to develop a great restaurant, in contrast, thrives on inconsistency. The first step involves finding a partner who has a personal vision for a restaurant. Meyer’s own vision resulted in the Union Square Café, considered by many to be the best restaurant in New York, and Tabla was the inspiration of former Union Square chef Michael Romano, now a full partner of the group. The rough vision is then turned over to a chef eager to spin it into a fully imagined experience, with full autonomy to shape the menu as he sees fit. Each restaurant becomes an independent corporation co-owned by the group, the partner, and the chef. In fact, the only constraint that Meyer and his company place on the venture is that it be different from everything else out there, and the more different, the better. In some cases, the vision draws on a familiar idea, but it never ends up with a conventional result. Susan Salgado, a director with Meyer’s company, offers the group’s “Jazz Standard” as an example. “Jazz clubs are usually dark, dingy, and have lousy food,” she says. “So our jazz club is clean, roomy, with excellent food.”</p><p>The group is so determined to maintain each restaurant’s individuality that it even eschews such obvious opportunities for economies of scale as standardizing paper products. The group is not entirely hands off, though. For one thing, it provides some computer, accounting, marketing, and administrative services to all the restaurants. More important, Meyer urges a loose operational philosophy for the entire enterprise—one aspect of which is that managers shouldn’t be autocrats in the restaurants. It sounds like a reasonable constraint, but it can take some getting used to for top chefs, who are typically trained in the French tradition in which the head chef is absolute, heavy-handed ruler, if not raging tyrant. Tabla chef Floyd Cardoz stops by our table and tells us he too came up under the “abusive chef” model, and had to adjust. “I like it this way better,” he says. One reason Meyer insists on nondespotic chefs is out of respect for employees, whom the group generally treats well; its policy of providing free health and dental insurance and 401k plans, for example, is generous by any standard and off the charts in the restaurant world. But even more important, Salgado explains, Meyer wants the kitchens of his restaurants to be scenes of rampant and collegial improvisation, not dictatorial consistency and rigidity. Cardoz notes that he often works without recipes, wielding some twenty-one different spices. “I just play,” he has said of his approach to creating dishes.</p><p>An emphasis on improvisation is in fact a larger part of the Meyer philosophy and applies at least as much to how servers interact with customers as it does in the kitchen. In Tabla, waiters seem to be almost prowling through the restaurant, on the hunt for a customer who might in some way need attention. But they prove to be neither brusquely hyperefficient nor fawning; rather, they are relaxed and engaging. Diners who mention that they are having trouble deciding between two dishes might be surprised to find their waiter bringing them small dishes of each. A $35 glass of dessert wine that tempts but is ultimately judged too big a splurge might end up on a table anyway, a waiter’s gift. These are the sorts of delightful shocks that engrave a dining experience into memory. To make sure waiters are good at improvising them, the Meyer philosophy includes the notion that traditional serving skills be somewhat downplayed in the hiring process. “We’re looking for people with the emotional capacity to deliver hospitality,” says Salgado. If they care and can express it in creative ways, the rest can be taught, figures Meyer.</p><p>But a restaurant can’t run well as a glorious mess of improvisation. At any one time, as many as fifty dishes are in some stage of preparation at Tabla, and they have to be completed and delivered to tables with impeccable timing—a mechanically complex process that, if marred in any way, will ruin a dining experience no matter how brilliant the menu or engaging the waiters. In most restaurants, waiters typically do what they can to avoid extraneous interactions with customers, so they can focus on getting a correctly prepared dish to the right diner at the right time. But Meyer wanted to indulge and even encourage happy surprises at the customer end. To do it, he realized, the waiters would need to be able to rely on a highly ordered, highly predictable system of preparing and delivering food, leaving them free to improvise with customers on everything else. And that notion of a measure of randomness supported by a layer of order is the final pillar of the group’s philosophy.</p><p>At Tabla, for example, exhaustive, explicit systems are in place for preparing ingredients, setting up the tables, running drinks, and assigning customers and waiters to tables: each waiter oversees two tables, each table at a different stage of the meal. An “expediter” in the kitchen essentially serves as a highly ordered interface between the improvisation in the recipes and the improvisation at the customer end, tracking by clipboard every order that comes into the kitchen and every dish that goes out to make sure the dozens of dishes are prepared and dispatched at the right time and in the right order. To fine-tune the systems and confirm that customers are getting the right sorts of surprises, the entire Tabla staff meets three times a day, for as long as an hour and a half per meeting, coordinating responsibilities and ironing out wrinkles. “Danny’s model for a restaurant is a jazz ensemble,” Salgado explains. “There’s a background theme that’s predictable, and the instruments can improvise around it.”</p><p>In other words, the pleasurable surprises that make Meyer’s restaurants unique depend on the kind of order that’s standard in the restaurant trade. But as in life, it’s variety that’s the spice.</p><p class="h1">More Messy Successes</p><p class="p1"><strong>Messy Goliath</strong> Even when small companies become large ones, they can continue to reflect the personalities of their founder-leaders, and that can be especially true with regard to the level of messiness ingrained in the culture. One interesting example is the contrast between Microsoft and Apple Computer. Apple tends to get better press and word of mouth than Microsoft does, in part because it is the underdog to industry-dominant Microsoft, and also because Apple has won the devotion of fans of its products’ high style. Because of Apple’s status as David to Microsoft’s Goliath, it’s also tempting to imagine that Apple is the freewheeling, improvising rebel while Microsoft is a lumbering, rigid bureaucracy. In fact, Microsoft has always operated in a usefully messy fashion, while Apple is the picture of rigid order. Considering Apple CEO Steve Jobs and Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, it would be surprising if it were otherwise. Jobs is famously a fastidious, turtleneck-only control freak widely known to rage at his teams when they’ve diverged from precise goals and schedules. Gates is known for encouraging independent teams to go off in many, often conflicting, directions, and is more tolerant of delays and changes. (And Gates could never be accused of fastidiousness in appearance, though he has neatened up a bit in recent years.) Apple has always focused on and driven toward a single, narrow goal—originally a more stylish PC, and then, when Apple couldn’t make much headway there, an emphasis on stylish multimedia devices, most notably of late the iPod. Microsoft, meanwhile, has tried to enter virtually every corner of the computer world, from PCs to corporate servers to application software to multimedia to search engines. Apple keeps its developing products under tight wraps until it is ready to introduce them with a big bang as fully realized gems. Microsoft often throws together, under little secrecy, buggy, ill-functioning first versions of products, and then keeps fixing, shifting, and tweaking them until they’re the most popular out there: The company’s Xbox 360 video-game console, rushed out in a first version prone to crashing and even electrically frying, still went on to win an enthusiastic following. And Windows, Word, and Excel are now such utterly dominant products in their fields that it’s easy to forget they were sneered at as unmitigated disasters in early incarnations. Apple finally scored a large hit with the iPod, but by early 2006 analysts were predicting the iPod would soon be losing market share.</p><p class="spb"><strong>A Few Good Messes</strong> The U.S. Marines operate under the same sort of rigid, pyramidal hierarchy as all the armed forces, which generally means that every officer has three officers reporting to him or her, right down the line from generals to corporals. But when critical situations—especially combat—render the chain of command a cumbersome source of delay, Marines at all levels know from training that they are expected to seize whatever decision-making responsibilities are needed to get the job done. That’s why when Marines meet for a premission planning session—never earlier than the night before a mission as per “plan early, plan twice”—the mission orders are given in loose form, describing broad goals and restrictions rather than specific actions. Why specify rigid actions when the fast-changing dynamics of battle are likely to render them irrelevant? If war is a mess, than warriors should be messy, too.</p><p class="spb"><strong>Messy Portfolios</strong> An entrepreneur can be usefully messy in ways that aren’t reflected in the messiness of any one company. The disorder can instead manifest itself over multiple companies. But a skilled entrepreneur can find ways to benefit from the sprawl. Take David Slawson, whose past ventures have included, in order, a burger joint, a massage therapy practice, an alternative health care school, a clean-air car manufacturer, an ecology cable channel, and an herbal supplement distributorship. Most recently, Slawson founded and ran a company called Stirling Energy Systems, which builds solar energy power plants, and he’s won $3 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Energy and a preliminary agreement to provide a major utility with up to $2.7 billion worth of electricity over twenty years, with another $1.4 billion under close discussion with another utility. One reason he won contracts is that, unlike many alternative power ventures, Slawson has been able to establish a track record of attracting private investment, averaging $2 million a year for nine years. The secret to his fund-raising? Slawson taps into the vast, affluent crowd of alternative health care and environmentally conscious contacts he gradually amassed through all of his other ventures, many of whom are also fans of clean power.</p><p class="spb">It’s tempting, in considering these examples, to try to extract rules that lay out the secrets of effective, messy leadership and management. But the truth is, every manager who successfully incorporates a degree of mess into her organization seems to do it differently. And that’s really part of the point, of course. Mess is about flexibility, variation, inconsistency, and the unexpected. If there were a single right way to do it, it wouldn’t be messy. The best advice to the would-be disorder-savvy business leader: go and find your own way to mess up a company.</p></div></body></html>
