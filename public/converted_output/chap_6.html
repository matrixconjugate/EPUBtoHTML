Most non–New Yorkers would be surprised at how little that kind of money buys at this sort of address; in this case, a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with a tiny kitchen and no dining room. Melissa takes us on a tour of the apartment, which turns up nothing untoward. Yes, it’s a cluttered apartment, except for the relatively spacious and nearly empty foyer, but the overall sense is that of a slightly cramped, very lived-in space—nothing that a few hours of routine straightening up couldn’t handle.</p><p>To Melissa, though, the disorder is nothing short of shameful. She is a warm, talkative, Ivy League–educated, successful songwriter who cowrote a Broadway musical and is the mother of a happy three-year-old. But all this is as nothing when she confronts her failure to keep the apartment neat. She can’t have people over. There are intimations of clutter-related tension in the marriage. Her mother was messy—to this day, her mother keeps multiple pairs of reading glasses around the house because she can’t keep track of any one pair, can you <em>imagine?</em>—and now Melissa has turned out to be messy. What if she passes this curse on to Monty?</p><p>Brian Saipe, professional organizer, listens with obvious sympathy. An animated, compact man with boyish good looks, Saipe has been called in by Melissa at $100 per hour to nip this multigenerational tragedy in the bud. He responds to Melissa’s confession with a matter-of-fact stream of smooth chatter—he is, in his own words, after all, a “domestic therapist.” Disorganization is nothing to be ashamed of, he tells Melissa. It’s not a sign of moral failure. It’s more like a sort of virus—a virus that invades all parts of your life, killing everything. She nods wanly, having suspected as much.</p><p>Reluctantly, Melissa reveals that there is another level to her living hell that she has yet to show Saipe. She refers to it as her “garage,” with heavy oral quotation marks. She leads the way back to one of the bathrooms, where a previous peek had revealed nothing more sinister than a stray rubber duck and a few dried toothpaste stains. This time she indicates the opaque, closed shower door, then looks away and waits. She has never shared this with an outsider, she mumbles. For a brief moment, the horror of what lurks behind that door hangs heavy in the air.</p><p>Saipe, undaunted, squares his shoulders and flings open the door in the practiced fashion of a mechanic popping a car hood from which oily smoke is seeping. Confronting us is a seven-foot-tall wall of...well, nothing stands out as immediately identifiable. This dense shower-space heap might contain body parts, plutonium, sacred scrolls, or the components of a time machine. What’s more, after hesitating for a moment, as if surprised by the light, the pile has started to shift and teeter, and commences to topple over. But Saipe actually seems to have expected this—the lurching forth of compacted clutter from behind sprung doors is the stuff of routine in his world—and he deftly deploys most of his body to restrain it, while somehow maneuvering the door back into place. “Let’s begin here,” he says, with no hint of discombobulation or irony.</p><p>The “garage,” as it turns out, represents the apex of Melissa’s shame. Yes, she and her husband, Ben, have managed to pack several closets to the gills as well, but that’s par for the course. Filling up a shower is, in her mind, beyond the pale and a sure sign of the deep toll that the mess virus has taken in her family’s life. Once fully excavated—it takes about a half hour—the contents of the shower-garage are revealed to be mundane. There are toys, electronic gear, kitchen utensils, and many types of bags. But the single biggest category of stuff in the pile turns out to be organizing implements, including shelves, hook assemblies, wastebaskets (three of them), and bins and boxes. Similar implements later show up strewn elsewhere in the apartment, and Melissa confesses to having spent $500 on organizing tools in just one trip to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. There are several getting-organized-related tomes mixed into the home library. This is all typical, Saipe assures Melissa, explaining that do-it-yourself organizing is usually a lost cause.</p><p>Now it’s time to pare down the apartment’s eclectic inventory to a manageable size. The Colonel, as Melissa now only half-teasingly calls Saipe, adheres to the “SPACE” technique, one of a small zoo of acronym-based verbal aids that organizers enlist to organize the organizing process. SPACE, which is one of the more popular ones in the industry, stands for <em>s</em>ort, <em>p</em>urge, <em>a</em>ssign a home, <em>c</em>ontainerize, and <em>e</em>qualize. <em>Sorting</em> involves pulling everything out of drawers, closets, and other hiding places, heaping it on the floors, and then moving it around until things are grouped logically. (Clothes with clothes, toys with toys, and so on.) <em>Purging</em> means shipping as much as possible out of the home, whether via trash, family and friend giveaways, or charity donations. (Some people also consider the options of eBay or garage sales or, as a last resort, remote storage.) <em>Assigning a home</em> means finding a place for the stuff that’s retained. (Socks in a sock drawer, for example.) <em>Containerize</em> is simply a matter of getting loose collections of like items into boxes or bins or onto shelves. <em>Equalize</em>—some organizers use <em>evaluate</em>—means fine-tuning the system as necessary until it is running like clockwork.</p><p>Purging proves the hard part, and it is where the Colonel, who has changed into a T-shirt and shorts for the job, shows his tough side. Not sure? he asks rhetorically, when Melissa pauses over a battery-powered corkscrew. Then chuck it. As a rule, he says, people use only 20 percent of their possessions and won’t ever miss the other 80 percent.</p><p>Melissa hesitates again and again, though. The plethora of stuffed animals throughout the apartment were gifts to Monty. (The Colonel pointedly opines that once a gift is given, it’s the recipient’s to throw out.) The furry handcuffs were a souvenir of the Broadway musical. (The Colonel is silent.) The Tony Robbins section of the library? The seashell collection tucked in a drawer? Be strong, the Colonel advises.</p><p>Husband Ben isn’t around for the organizing—also typical, says the Colonel, nonjudgmentally—so Melissa has to render some decisions on his behalf, during which process a certain ire leaks out. “He hasn’t done yoga since we moved here,” she grumbles, tossing a mat into the reject pile. “He hasn’t played guitar since we moved here, either,” she adds, but is able to restrain herself from tossing out his guitars. Melissa seems to resent Ben for managing to hang on to a raft of unneeded items without, as she sees it, sinking to her level of shameful disorganization—though in fact Ben’s two closets are only marginally neater than hers.</p><p>Containerizing requires a trip to the Container Store, where Melissa, perhaps drained from the effort of purging, becomes oddly infantilized. She picks out childish organizing implements like pencil holders with animal faces (which the Colonel patiently directs her to put back), declares that she is hungry, and clings anxiously to a proffered arm. The Colonel is ready with a pep talk: Did she know that the average American spends one hour a day searching for things? That’s twelve hours per week, he adds for emphasis. If Melissa questions the math, she shows no sign of it. She does point out, though, that not long ago she misplaced a contract and had to interrupt her husband at work to have him fax her a copy of it.</p><p>Over the course of four visits from the Colonel, Melissa’s apartment is rendered utterly, perfectly neat and ordered. There isn’t much stuff left, and what’s left is all tucked away in an appropriate place. The furniture has been rearranged. Not surprisingly, the lived-in look is gone. As an unexpected side effect, the apartment seems dingier—with nothing else to look at, one becomes aware that the furniture is a little worn and mismatched, the rugs are a bit threadbare, the walls sport a range of flaws. In any case, Melissa seems happy, if a little weary of the whole process, and says she’s determined to hew faithfully to the new program.</p><p class="spb">Professional organizers have certain impressive skills—motivational vigor, patience, a flair for the logical arrangement of time and space—and offer a large bag of tricks. Hiring one will likely get your home straightened up, if at a cost of at least a few thousand dollars. Perhaps reading one of their books will help you do it on your own. Maybe having gadgets to keep empty bags sorted and shoes lined up will come in handy, too.</p><p>But professional organizers and their tools may ultimately do more harm than good, even ignoring their cost. The biggest problem is that the marketing of the home-organization industry perpetrates and amplifies—even if it doesn’t originate—the notion that most of us have a lot of neatening up to do. On top of that, the litany of organizing advice communicates that straightening up is a job that requires a big commitment, expertise, a large block of time, and an array of paraphernalia.</p><p>One of the main points of this book is that there’s already too much emphasis on and advice about how to get organized. We’d prefer that people consider less-ordered alternatives in many situations, including the home. However, it’s not entirely irrational or in any way wrong to want to straighten up your home, and some of the help and advice in that arena is worth engaging. In fact, professional organizers clearly accomplish something that’s useful to many of their clients. But the important part of straightening up is actually quite simple, and you can do it for free, easily, with no expertise. You may not even have to do any more than you’re doing now.</p><p class="p3">Let’s boil everything down to what’s really involved in straightening up. We’ll present it in the form of our own catchy acronym, ACE:</p><p class="ul1"><em>A</em>w, relax</p><p class="ul"><em>C</em>arve out time</p><p class="ul3"><em>E</em>ject some stuff</p><p class="h1">Aw, Relax</p><p class="p1">People tend to worry about home mess too much and often for no good reason. Many of us are busier than ever with work or parenting or both, and letting your home get a little, or even more than a little, messy probably isn’t going to hurt anyone. But there’s a great deal of external pressure to keep a reasonably neat home, and not just from the constant stream of “be neat” messages we get from the media. It also comes from friends, colleagues, neighbors, and relatives. The fact is, many people will think less of you for keeping a messy home. And occasionally, they’ll even let you know about it.</p><p>In one unpretentious neighborhood in Florida, a young professional couple with two children sometimes left toys and tricycles and the like sitting in the yard. A group of their neighbors, some of whom are full-time homemakers or retirees with a little more time on their hands, decided they were tired of looking at the modest clutter and came over one morning when no one was at home to clean up the yard. One can imagine how mortified the couple was to learn about the secret tidying party. Neighbors aren’t likely to come inside your home to do the same, but relatives and more outspoken friends won’t always resist the urge to make comments about your clutter. And while people meeting you for the first time probably won’t say anything about the messiness of your home, they may well be busy forming a vivid first impression based on it. According to a study at the University of Texas at Austin, people walking into the room of a stranger when he isn’t present form surprisingly strong and detailed opinions about that person—including the conviction that a cluttered room is a sign of a person who isn’t “conscientious.”</p><p>And just hope your messy home doesn’t one day get introduced to a jury of your peers. When Michael Jackson was facing charges of molesting a thirteen-year-old boy, the courtroom was presented a video tour of the pop star’s home taken by the local sheriff’s office during a raid. Of central interest, according to several news accounts of the video tour, was the lack of conventional order in Jackson’s home. As CNN put it, “The video showed the house cluttered with shoe boxes, books, and a variety of objects stacked on the floors.” Agence France-Presse noted, “The overall image was a peculiar mix of ostentatious opulence and cluttered confusion.” Mentioned almost parenthetically in some of the accounts, and omitted altogether from others, was the fact that the raid had turned up pornographic magazines that contained both Jackson’s and his accuser’s fingerprints. Apparently, the real damning evidence was those scattered shoe boxes.</p><p>If you’re a parent, aren’t you failing your children by keeping a messy home? Aside from the fact that you’re passing on the curse of messiness, you’re also making your children stupid, according to a study at the Pennsylvania State University. Researchers there looked at historical British databases of information on twins to determine that “disorganized” homes tend to produce children with lower cognitive skills. Oh, by the way—home order, as characterized in the study, also correlated with parental socioeconomic status and the level of parental education. But the study’s authors claim they took all of that into account and were able to pin the “profound” deficit of cognitive skills that turned up in many messy homes on the disorder itself. So it’s not less educated parents, rough neighborhoods, and poor schools that adversely affect children’s test performance, it’s keeping a messy home. Well, could it possibly have turned out otherwise? The study’s authors didn’t think so. “It just makes sense,” one of the researchers was quoted as saying. “If a kid is in a really chaotic home, it’s hard to imagine that they can learn in a normal way.” Given that any other findings would have been nearly unimaginable—it’s <em>obvious</em> that messy homes stunt kids’ brains—it’s impressive the researchers went through the trouble of running any data through their models.</p><p>Actually, messy homes can provide a far more inviting and nurturing environment than highly ordered ones. For one thing, cluttered homes tell us more about the personalities of its occupants than do homes stripped to their carefully arranged essentials. It’s the optional, extraneous items we leave lying around that bear the stamp of our quirky inner selves. The authors of the University of Texas study of how people judge others by their rooms take the time in the study to quote from John Steinbeck’s <em>Travels with Charley:</em></p><p class="ext1">As I sat in this unmade room, Lonesome Harry began to take shape and dimension. I could feel that recently departed guest in the bits and pieces of himself he had left behind.</p><p class="p1">Specifically, the authors note, what Lonesome Harry left behind were laundry receipts, a discarded unfinished letter, an empty bourbon bottle, and other elements of what we’d have to consider something of a mess. “It would seem,” the authors go on to say, “that the environments that people craft around themselves are rich with information about their personalities, values, and lifestyles.” Unless, of course, the environments are sparse and pristine, in which case we learn only that their occupants are neat freaks.</p><p>The writer Caitlin Flanagan has posited that people who are tempted to turn to professional organizers often feel that something is out of kilter in their lives, and they mistakenly attribute the problem to a lack of neatness and order in their homes. She goes on to quote from Cheryl Mendelson’s book, <em>Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House,</em> which notes this of home-order enthusiasts:</p><p class="ext4">They arrange their shoes along the color spectrum in a straight line and suffer anxiety if the towels on the shelf do not all face the same way. They expend enormous effort on what they think of as housekeeping, but their homes often are not welcoming. Who can feel at home in a place where the demand for order is so exaggerated? In housekeeping, more is not always better. Order and cleanliness should not cost more than the value they bring in health, efficiency, and convenience.</p><p class="p1">Even some interior designers are now explicitly embracing mess in their work. Ilse Crawford, the former editor of <em>Elle Decoration</em> who runs an acclaimed London design firm, filled her recent book, <em>Home Is Where the Heart Is,</em> with photographs of jammed rooms strewn with hodgepodges of mismatching pillows, scattered clothes, and even litter. Calling the home “a canvas for self-expression,” Crawford has explained that her intention is to counter the sparse and overly ordered sensibility that has dominated home interior design and to achieve an effect that feels more relaxed, human, and intimate, with a large measure of what she calls “laissez-faire”—inspired in part, she says, by psychologist Abraham Maslow’s self-actualization theory and its appreciation of spontaneity and individuality. (Speaking of home mess and the inner mind, Freud was an inveterate clutterer who jammed an antique collection of some two thousand pieces into his home and office.)</p><p>Aesthetic preference and emotional comfort aside, what about physical health? Isn’t a neater home cleaner and therefore less likely to harbor disease-causing germs? Not to get hung up on semantics here, but cleanliness usually refers to an absence of grime, which could include stray microorganisms and other biological matter, while neatness implies an absence of clutter and disarray. One could imagine being messy but clean, with spotless items strewn over a spotless floor, or neat but not clean, with a completely stripped down room coated with slime. But it’s not unreasonable to assume some overlap between mess and uncleanliness. For one thing, it’s harder to clean with lots of stuff scattered around. And let’s be realistic: if a person is too busy to pick up around the house, then she may well be too busy to vacuum and scrub with any frequency.</p><p>Our society has become somewhat germaphobic. In a poll of more than 3,600 visitors to the ChildFun Web site, two-thirds of respondents said they wash their hands eight or more times a day, and more than a fifth of them wash more than twenty times a day. A fond wish of an increasing number of Americans is to be able to move through the world outside their homes without ever having to touch anything. Mike Herpio is the head of a Finnish company called FogScreen that markets a device that replaces computer or television screens with a nearly invisible slab of water vapor onto which images can be projected. The effect is of an image hanging in midair, and a person can interact with the image—selecting buttons, for example, or punching in numbers—by poking at the image with a finger. For all the interesting applications that might come to mind for a video or computer image that can be instantly conjured up to float in space, Herpio reports that one of the biggest near-term demands is for installing the device in public information kiosks, because people are becoming increasingly uneasy about punching touch screens or keyboards that other human fingers have touched.</p><p>The risks are hugely overblown. <em>Today</em> sent an infectious disease specialist on a tour of New York City malls, subways, and public bathrooms to swab many of the various surfaces people might touch, dutifully reporting the revolting findings. (Fecal matter on escalator railings!) Slipped in at the end of the segment, almost in passing, was the expert’s comment that none of the terrible-sounding microbes found in a busy day of swabbing was likely to cause illness. Germs encountered on the surfaces inside homes are even less likely to be problematic. So don’t put too much stock in the advice of home hygiene experts, who not all that long ago urged chucking out messy wooden cutting boards in favor of neat, smooth plastic ones that wouldn’t harbor germs—advice that turned out to be exactly backward.</p><p>Parents, unsurprisingly, are particularly sensitive to warnings about hygiene. The poll of parents of six- to twelve-year-olds mentioned in the previous chapter found that 96 percent of them “believe that the cleanliness of a child’s room is very or somewhat important to their child’s health.” Germs aren’t the only concern; allergy triggers such as dust mites and pet dander are perceived as equally serious threats. Two-thirds of the respondents managed to find time to vacuum their children’s rooms once a week or more. It’s true, allergens found in the home may exacerbate the symptoms of some of the fifty million children and adults in the United States who suffer from asthma or other respiratory illnesses. But most asthma and allergy experts now maintain that exposure to common triggers can’t actually cause these ailments, as was once believed.</p><p>Guess what can, though: very clean homes. Researchers at the Curtin University of Technology in Australia found that children exposed to fumes from home-cleaning products, among other chemicals, were up to four times more likely to develop asthma, even when exposure remained within what are currently regarded as safe levels. Another risk factor, oddly enough, is an unusually <em>low</em> level of allergens in the home. According to research reported in the British medical journal <em>Thorax,</em> children who aren’t sufficiently exposed to allergens when they’re very young are more likely to develop reactions when later exposed to normal levels. Kids who confront allergens all along, on the other hand, are more likely to become desensitized to them. Those scrubbing their hands and homes with antibacterial cleansers might also ponder the growing body of evidence that suggests these cleansers produce even hardier strains of bacteria than the ones they’re designed to kill.</p><p>As for children needing neatness and order in their environment to learn normally, that quaint but persistent notion has been discredited. Studying in a noisy, messy, disordered home may seem like a common sense–defying circus trick to those of us who were brought up decades ago in relatively orderly homes run by a full-time homemaker and were conditioned to seek out stillness when in need of concentration. But today, with both parents often working and overtaxed, there is rarely anyone standing over a student’s shoulder trying to enforce a neat-and-quiet-work-area rule. And as it turns out, children appear to be able to study comfortably and effectively while listening to music blaring through earbuds, carrying on a dozen simultaneous instant-messaging conversations on the computer, working the cell phone, and fending off the massive, messy pile of books and papers spilling out of a bursting-at-the-seams backpack. In fact, studies have shown that movement and various other forms of stimulation during learning can help create a “memory stamping” effect that aids in retaining information. A Cornell University study of students allowed to surf the Web <em>during class</em> found that the more often students turned their attention to the Web, the likelier they were to get higher grades, and that held true in both lecture and discussion-style classes. Many elementary and high schools, for that matter, don’t have libraries any more; they have bustling, buzzy multimedia centers. In short, parents who must choose between spending time maintaining a neat and orderly home, and helping children with homework, attending their numerous extracurricular events, and in general being nurturing and supportive, shouldn’t have to labor over the decision.</p><p class="spb1"><strong>A Room-by-Room Guide to Worrying Less about Mess</strong></p><p class="spb"><em>The kitchen:</em> The next time you find yourself contemplating the purchase of a kitchen organizing gadget like the $80 SmartSpice rotating spice rack featuring sixteen identical containers and an integrated alarm-timer and cookbook slot, think instead about buying another one of those fifty-cent items that represent many homes’ most important organizing tool: a magnet. In seconds, convert the front of a refrigerator into a messy, invaluable repository of photographs, important bills, shopping lists, and soccer schedules. And then consider these words from Gabrielle Hamilton, owner-chef of the New York City restaurant Prune, writing in the <em>New York Times</em> of her visit to her mother-in-law in a village in Italy:</p><p class="ext1">She only measures anything for my benefit, so I can write it down and make a recipe, but I’m glad every time to see her dump the car keys and daily mail that sit in the pan of the old balance scale and weigh out flour—from her own wheat!—by throwing little brass weights into the other pan.</p><p class="ext">When she pulls her old sawed-off broom handle out of the kitchen drawer to roll out the dough, I sigh happily to be so far away, literally and conceptually, from my stainless steel restaurant kitchen where the freezers all freeze to precise Department of Health standards, and there’s a knife for turning, for boning, for filleting; there’s a wet stone and a dry stone, and the need for improvisation arises rarely.</p><p class="spb"><em>Closets:</em> According to <em>Closets</em> magazine, Americans spend more than $2 billion a year on closet renovations. An array of companies exist solely to provide custom closet-organizing systems and services, typically charging between $1,000 and $10,000, though a heavy-duty closet makeover can run more than $15,000. Unless you truly don’t know what to do with your money, could it possibly be worth spending several thousand dollars to get a closet organized? Preprinted clothes-hanger labels, available from a company called Living Order, offer a far less costly way to introduce a ludicrous level of order to a closet.</p><p class="spb"><em>The bedroom:</em> You rarely use it during the day, you’re asleep when you’re in it at night, and unless you’re heavily dating there isn’t much call for bringing guests into it. All in all, the bedroom is a pretty good place to maintain a mess. As some would say, making a bed when you get up in the morning is like tying a shoe after you’ve taken it off.</p><p class="spb"><em>The living room:</em> It’s the one room that most people keep fairly neat, simply because they use it least often, preserving it for entertaining. In other words, not all that much living goes on in most living rooms. This touches on one of the principles of mess: neatness and usefulness tend to be inversely related. Living rooms are often the sites of CD collections, which can reflect various standards of utility—or none at all. It’s easy to make a CD collection look ordered, thanks to the fact that CDs stack or line up so neatly on shelves. Ordering them beyond that can entail several options, as Nick Hornby explored in his novel <em>High Fidelity,</em> in which a main character orders and reorders a vast record collection not merely by performer, or type of music, or frequency played, but also by association of the music with life events, such as a particular girlfriend. An important point to grasp, though, is that whatever scheme is used to organize a CD collection, that scheme will render the collection a mess by most other criteria. In other words, if the CDs are organized alphabetically by performer, then they will be randomly organized with regard to type of music. That’s another mess principle, of course: to organize in one way is to mess up in another. If you are considering spending hours meticulously ordering a CD collection, you may want to think about the fact that after Apple brought out the iPod, the ideal device for neatly categorizing thousands of songs, it discovered to virtually everyone’s surprise that the most popular feature was the “shuffle” capability, which plays tunes in random order. That led to the introduction of the iPod Shuffle model, which features random order play and has been a big seller.</p><p class="spb"><em>The dining room:</em> Given how rarely most people eat in their dining rooms, who’s to say it isn’t more useful to use the table as a handy platform for everything from mail to unsorted clothes to business-card collections? Apparently, that is exactly what many, if not most, people do, given that professional organizers say that their most frequent call for help centers on a dining room table submerged under mess.</p><p class="spb"><em>The garage:</em> A company called GarageTek sends out postcard-style advertisements featuring a photo of a family posing with beaming pride in their newly made-over garage. With its sparse, high-tech decor and pristine monotone surfaces, the garage looks as if it has been prepped as a site for oral surgery rather than for changing the oil in the lawn mower or holding the trash or receiving the kids’ baseball gloves and sleds. Does anyone really need a garage that’s so neat that the family will be afraid to mar it with actual use?</p><p class="spb"><em>Cars:</em> Actually, in cars, neatness makes sense. The ratio of time spent in a car to its limited and easily cluttered interior volume—that is, mess-hours per cubic foot—is an order of magnitude higher than it’s likely to be in any room in your home or at work. Things left on a car floor can become soiled and torn under shoes, can work their way under a seat where retrieval requires confronting grease and sharp metal, and can even slide under and jam the brake pedal. Things left on the seats can be sat on, can leave stains or soil that can be transferred to passengers’ clothes, and can fall out when a door is opened. Because cars are usually closed spaces, spilled food and other substances can eventually produce overpowering and indelible odors. (Advice from National Public Radio’s <em>Car Talk</em> hosts Tom and Ray “Click and Clack” Magliozzi to owners of cars whose carpeting or upholstery has been in contact with fish or milk products: sell the car.) Loose items can roll and bang around with the car’s motion, distracting the driver and masking more important sounds like conversations, horns, and engine rattles. Clutter can bury maps, the car registration, the flashlight, and other items you might need urgently and in the dark. Anything left in the trunk can bake or freeze. Meanwhile, cars are exceptionally easy to clean—a minute or two with an empty shopping bag usually does the trick.</p><p class="h1">Carve Out Time</p><p class="p1">Atlanta-based professional organizer Judith Kolberg tells this story:</p><p class="ext4">A woman hired me to help her organize her office. I showed up at her office and asked her to tell me what she had in mind. She started explaining what she wanted to do with the piles of paper on her desk and where she wanted to put the files, and as she explained it she started putting things away. I just took a seat and watched her. At the end of an hour the office was straightened up, and I had just sat there the entire time without saying anything. The woman looked around, and said to me, “Thank you so much. You’re the best organizer in the world.”</p><p class="p1">Kolberg said that while this was a slightly extreme example, she has on other occasions run into people who seem perfectly willing and capable of doing their own straightening, but simply don’t take the time to do so until a professional organizer shows up. Kolberg, whose slightly severe looks and dress belie a warm and ranging intelligence, is trained as a social worker and believes the effect that an organizer can have on a client is akin to the phenomenon of <em>body doubling.</em> Body doubling is a technique often employed by teachers and therapists of children who have special needs and may have trouble setting themselves to a task in the classroom. Instead of closely helping such a child complete the task, the teacher will simply stand just behind and a bit to the side of the child and remain there mostly silently; in many cases, the simple awareness of being watched over in this way is enough of an aid to keep the child usefully on track with the task. (Perhaps it’s a bit like the Hawthorne effect discussed in chapter 3.)</p><p>It may be, then, that what people who end up turning to professional organizers lack is not a knack for restoring a bit of order, but the motivation to put aside the time for doing so. If you were conditioned as a child to avoid straightening up until an authority figure made you do so, how, as an adult, could you make yourself take the time? Some organizers recommend assigning fifteen minutes or so at the same time every day or evening to neatening—a way of time organizing your space organizing. But most people should do fine with a more flexible approach. In the end, most of us prioritize tasks and apportion time reasonably well, even if it doesn’t always seem that way. If you’re having trouble getting yourself to take the time to straighten up, it may simply be that accumulating mess really isn’t all that important to you compared to the other things going on in your life. But if you think you’re a good candidate for body doubling when it comes to organizing your home, you could always ask a friend to stand over you and offer to return the favor, yielding a combined savings of several thousand dollars.</p><p class="h1">Eject Some Stuff</p><p class="p1">There is little question that sooner or later most of us need to get rid of stuff from our homes. We’ve become masters at acquiring things—Western society, at least, and especially life in the United States, is practically built around acquisition—but there are few external forces that prompt us to expel things other than trash from our homes once they’ve made it inside. A bigger home may take longer to fill, but people tend to keep acquiring until the pressure of accumulation builds and demands some sort of relief. As anyone who has watched a mess makeover on TV knows, by far the most important element of straightening up is simply getting rid of a vast sea of items that are no longer needed.</p><p>But tossing stuff out is difficult for many people. Professional organizers are prepared for this resistance and wield an array of techniques to break it down. These tricks include pushing clients into throwing as many items as possible into large, black trash bags or big cardboard boxes that quickly mask the items and can be whisked away before second thoughts set in, or making the client recall the last time an object was used and predict the next time he’ll need it, or having the client keep a photograph of the object as a substitute for the item. One organizer says that when a client exhibits a strong emotional attachment to an item that’s a candidate for the trash, she makes the client talk to the item as if it were a friend, to embarrass the client into realizing how silly it is to be overly tied to an object. All organizers reassure clients that they’ll ultimately be much happier having gotten rid of the stuff.</p><p>But is it really true that people won’t regret getting rid of some of the items that are cast out in the name of straightening up? In one TV mess makeover, an organizer rounded up the family’s two children and presided over a mass transference of the contents of a large closet of their possessions into boxes for removal. Kneeling on the floor with the kids as they hesitated over old school papers and long-neglected board games and stuffed animals, the organizer kept up a line of chatter about how awesome it was going to be to regain all that space while guiding their hands to the junk box. “This is so liberating,” the mother beamed, getting in on the fun. But the children were clearly torn over many of the items, perhaps with good reason. Wouldn’t any middle-ager get a thrill out of uncovering childhood drawings and the family Candyland game and passing them on to her own children?</p><p>In fact, all kinds of wonderful, valuable, and useful things get thrown out in the name of organizing. Almost anyone over age forty has had the experience of realizing with a pang that their childhood collections of baseball cards or comic books or Barbie dolls would be worth a fortune today, never mind their sentimental value. It’s hard to watch an episode of <em>Antiques Roadshow,</em> in which marvelous objects hauled in from attics are appraised for fantastic sums, without wondering what one’s own great-great-grandparents were thinking of when they neatened up their homes. There’s simply no getting around the fact that some of what we discard today represents future lost treasures.</p><p>How, then, to decide what should be thrown out and what should be kept? Organizers will tell you to err heavily on the side of chucking out, often offering the justification that if you haven’t used the item in a year it must not be useful to you. But this is silly; follow this advice and you’ll get rid of items that might have ultimately proved invaluable, like a beloved saxophone, or an heirloom chair you happen to have no place for at the moment, or a gas-powered generator that might come in awfully handy three years from now. A better yardstick than frequency of use is potential value and replaceability. Even if you use the stack of American Automobile Association guidebooks once a year, it’s easy to get new ones, so why not chuck them?</p><p>Part of the problem is that when it comes to getting organized, people tend to think in terms of Big Bang projects intended to utterly wipe out mess. That leads to the mass excising of a large percentage of possessions, which beside making for a potentially painful experience also increases the chances of throwing out things that will be sorely missed. Instead, why not throw out just enough to restore a comfortable amount of space and order, limiting the carnage to those items that prove no-brainers when it comes to telling the junk from the good stuff? There’s no place like home for maintaining some sentimental mess, after all.</p><p>As both John Steinbeck and the University of Texas researchers pointed out, our personalities tend to be more clearly expressed in our disorder than in our neatness. When we are being ruthless about ridding ourselves of what naturally accumulates around us and about meticulously straightening out what remains, we are in a sense tidying our identities. The truth is, we are all at least a bit of a mess—and all the more interesting for it.</p></div></body></html>
