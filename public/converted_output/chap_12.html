No one answered his knocks, the doors were locked, and the first-floor and basement windows were grilled, so the officer called for a crew to break down the front door. Waiting behind it was an impassable blockade of stacked furniture and boxes, intermingled with a strange assortment of other items, including parts of a sewing machine and a wine press. The clutter appeared to fill every cubic foot of the entire first floor of the house. A ladder provided access to a second-story window, but entrance was denied there, too, by a prodigious volume of tightly packed junk, consisting in no small portion of bundles of thousands of newspapers. The crew began to haul out the newspapers, along with a startling array of items in various states of disrepair, including a baby carriage, gardening implements, and umbrellas. As a path was painstakingly fashioned through the compacted melee of objects, a searcher came across the body of Homer Collyer, sixty-six, a former engineer, and one of two brothers who owned the home. It took seventeen days to remove enough trash and objects—including toys, tools, guns, dressmaking dummies, animal bones, and an X-ray machine—to find the body of the older second brother, Langley, a Columbia University–educated lawyer. Langley had suffocated under bundles of newspapers that had toppled over on him as he crawled through one of the narrow junk tunnels used to bring food to Homer, who had gone blind. Ultimately, more than 130 tons of junk were excavated from the home, all of which raised less than $2,000 at auction.</p><p>The tale of the Collyer brothers is an odd one, but not quite as odd as you might think. In December 2003 alone, New York City firefighters twice had to rescue residents nearly killed by the spectacular clutter in their homes—one trapped for days under a massive heap of magazines and books, the other almost unreachable behind a thick crop of ceiling-high piles of paper and other materials that had somehow ignited. (The rescuing firefighter in the latter case may be one of the few people ever to be officially commended for heroism in the face of life-threatening home clutter.) A dozen major U.S. cities have set up teams specifically tasked with helping people whose homes have become dangerously overfilled. It’s far from unheard of for people to close off entire sections of their homes with impassable junk. Among the several stories of extreme clutter reported in the survey conducted for this book was one about a couple who snuck into a parent’s home when he was away in order to clear out the ceiling-high piles upstairs, only to have the ceiling in one room collapse partway through the job—it turned out the piles had been supporting the ceiling, which was straining under the weight of the massive store of clutter in the attic.</p><p class="p3">The tendency to irrationally amass and hang on to extraordinarily large and dense collections of mostly useless items is sometimes known as <em>compulsive hoarding</em> or even <em>Collyer brothers syndrome,</em> but is usually simply called <em>hoarding.</em> Though hoarding hasn’t yet earned its own official diagnostic criteria in <em>DSM-IV,</em> the manual that serves as a guide for categorizing mental illness, it is mentioned there as a common symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Psychologists Tamara Hartl of Stanford University and Randy Frost of Smith College have long specialized in studying hoarding and together came up with these widely accepted diagnostic criteria:</p><p class="ul1">1.	The acquisition of, and failure to discard, a large number of possessions that appear to be useless or of limited value</p><p class="ul">2.	Living spaces sufficiently cluttered so as to preclude activities for which those spaces were designed</p><p class="ul3">3.	Significant distress or impairment in functioning caused by the hoarding</p><p class="spb">These criteria may be a bit broad. Does suffering shame over having lost a dining room table to old magazines or a shower to organizing gizmos qualify? But the important issue is clear: at some point one has to distinguish between the sort of ordinary, mostly harmless messiness that might even be a side effect of useful prioritizing, and an extreme, highly dysfunctional messiness that can severely impinge on daily life and may be associated with mental illness or at least a general failure to cope with the routine demands of the world.</p><p>There are several different flavors of hoarding. Its typical classification as an offshoot of OCD suggests that sufferers are compelled to collect and retain odd items in much the same way they might experience an irresistible urge to wash their hands hundreds of times a day or count all the tiles in a floor. Sanjaya Saxena, director of UCLA’s OCD research program, estimates that there are in the range of one million people in the United States who are OCD-driven hoarders. But OCD may not account for the majority of hoarders. Senior citizens afflicted with so-called Diogenes syndrome lose the motivation to care for themselves and lack interest in removing items that accumulate in their homes; the resulting clutter often consists largely of mounds of trash, a subdisorder called <em>syllogomania.</em> One reason the elderly are particularly vulnerable is that the tendency to self-neglect and hoard can be amplified by physical illness, loss of vision or hearing, and bereavement, notes Carlos Reyes-Ortiz, a geriatrician with the University of Texas Medical Branch who has studied the problem. Though there aren’t good figures to indicate how frequently a particular mental illness leads to hoarding, a study by researchers at King’s College in London of eighty-one people who “live in squalor” found that 49 percent of the people were over age sixty-five and 70 percent were diagnosed with a mental disorder. In a study of 233 people in Dublin who refused to let volunteers or the government provide some needed service, 54 percent were identified as hoarders and 47 percent as sufferers of Diogenes.</p><p>Smith College’s Frost is among those who argue that hoarding should be diagnosable as a unique mental illness on its own, along with what are often accompanying symptoms, including paranoia. Some hoarders appear to develop a turbocharged version of the common attachment to things professional organizers often observe in their clients, so that they actually become fearful of tossing out items. Yet another subdisorder, this fear is sometimes informally called <em>disposophobia.</em> Hoarding can also be focused on specific types of items, a frequent and especially problematic one being animals, as with the beleaguered “cat ladies” who occasionally pop up in local news. In other words, the diagnosis and thus the treatment of hoarding is itself a bit of a nasty mess and one that may leave millions of Americans metaphorically, and in some cases almost literally, drowning in their clutter.</p><p class="spb">Hopefully it’s clear by now that messiness and disorder are not always good things. Far from it. There are many situations in which mess simply gets out of control, hoarding being an obvious and striking instance. Let’s look at some other, more subtle examples, including a few where the troublesomeness of a mess depends on one’s point of view.</p><p class="h1">Mess and the Quirky Mind</p><p class="p1">Judith Kolberg, the Atlanta-based professional organizer whose “body doubling” strategies were mentioned in chapter 6, noticed soon after she began taking on clients in the late 1980s that a small portion of them seemed to face deeper difficulties. “Five to ten percent of them just weren’t getting it,” she says. “They’d try all the traditional organizational and time-management techniques over and over again, and they just kept failing.” One client had to endure a police investigation when a new housecleaner showed up and fled, believing the client’s home had been invaded and ransacked. Another filled the kitchen with empty margarine tubs and plastic bags, leaving her husband concerned for her mental health. Yet another, an otherwise successful manager, seemed incapable of gathering data into progress reports for his bosses and risked losing his job over it. One faced eviction over her clutter. These people weren’t merely anxious, guilty, or ashamed about messiness; their lives were taking sharp turns for the worse because of it.</p><p>When Kolberg attended the National Association of Professional Organizers conference in 1990, she mentioned her observation to some of her peers and was surprised to hear that most of them were similarly aware of a uniquely organizationally challenged minority among their clients. Other organizers tended to throw up their hands at these sorts of clients, but Kolberg was convinced they could be helped—just not through conventional organizing techniques. Some of these clients were probably suffering to some extent from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or other diagnosable conditions, but that didn’t seem to be the point when it came to helping them get minimally organized. The broader issue, Kolberg decided, was that these people didn’t seem to relate to conventional notions of organization.</p><p>So Kolberg attempted to come at organization from new angles. Instead of foisting standard techniques on these clients, Kolberg tried to determine what they were good at and then create individualized organizational styles to match their strengths. Called in by a high-powered scientific researcher whose inability to file had led to desk piles tall enough to block his view of the doorway and had left him unable to find even the most important papers, Kolberg noticed that he seemed to think of documents in highly idiosyncratic, personal terms; a tax document, for example, reminded him of a cat veterinary bill he had taken as a deduction. So Kolberg devised an “emotional filing system” consisting of three categories: “Keeping Me Out of Jail” (alimony, traffic violations, IRS and other documents critically requiring response), “Keeping People Off My Back” (bills and reports), and “Me” (awards, newspaper clips, and other items of personal interest). She suggested a system based on anatomy to sort out the disarray in a doctor’s office, including a “stomach” to digest information, a “brain” to make decisions about it, and a “liver” to remove waste. The manager who couldn’t put together reports turned out to be an aspiring actor, so she helped him devise “scenes” with his subordinates in which he played the role of various characters performing acts of information-gathering, such as a lawyer taking testimony from a witness. While such clients rarely became paragons of organization, Kolberg found her techniques could keep them just ordered enough to avoid the sorts of small disasters they had been facing.</p><p>Kolberg went on to write the book <em>Conquering Chronic Disorganization</em> and founded the National Study Group on Chronic Disorganization, which sponsors research and disseminates information to professionals and the public. One publication from the organization available on its Web site defines five levels of clutter; if you feel anxiety over your messiness, it will almost certainly help put your problems into perspective. Level III, for example, includes light structural damage to the home, a television stored outside, audible evidence of rodents, the presence of hazardous chemicals and broken glass, and “obvious and irritating” odors. Bear in mind there are two full levels worse than this one, but they’re not for the faint of heart. On the other hand, some professional organizers’ promotional literature lists far more routine levels of mess, such as a cluttered dining room table, as sure signs of chronic disorganization, apparently in the hopes of literally scaring up business. Take it from the real experts: messy dining room tables and unmade beds aren’t the problem. It’s when you can’t get through the doorways of your home or can’t find room enough on your bed to lie down that it’s time to seek help.</p><p class="p3">There are several mental disorders listed in the <em>DSM-IV</em> whose symptoms can include various types of mess. These include the OCD-related hoarding already noted, as well as difficulties in “planning, organizing, [and] sequencing” associated with Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia. But if you’re looking for a diagnosable mental disorder whose symptoms read much like a red-flag checklist ripped from a professional organizer’s leather binder, then you’ve got to go with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ADHD, sometimes referred to as ADD, for attention deficit disorder—the hyperactivity isn’t always part of the package—includes as possible diagnostic criteria the following, as excerpted from the manual:</p><p class="ul1">often fails to give close attention to details</p><p class="ul">often has difficulty sustaining attention</p><p class="ul">often has difficulty organizing tasks and details</p><p class="ul">often loses things</p><p class="ul">is often easily distracted</p><p class="ul3">often runs about or climbs excessively</p><p class="spb">Thus encompassing time sprawl, distraction, improvisation, blur, and bounce, ADHD appears to comprise a wide-ranging portfolio of mess. These forms of mess can be highly useful, of course. But it’s not hard to see how a child—or an adult, given that up to two-thirds of children with ADHD are now believed to carry the disorder into their grown-up years—might well be considered a victim of pathological mess. After all, it’s not as if someone with ADHD can pick and choose when, how, and in what modest measure they will apply which type of mess. Professional organizer and “coach” Denslow Brown, who specializes in working with people with ADHD, explains that for many of her clients, simply getting dressed in the morning in a reasonable amount of time is a daunting challenge. To help them, Brown breaks down the task into a set sequence of small steps, such as selecting a pair of socks, sitting down on the side of the bed, placing a sock on the left foot, and so forth. Without this sort of prepared sequence in the morning, and sometimes throughout the day, her clients can end up jumping around between partially completed tasks, many of which they lose track of. “They have trouble handling interruptions,” she says. “The family, the mail, the TV, the phone—it’s an onslaught to them, and whatever makes the loudest noise gets their attention.”</p><p>But is the mess associated with ADHD necessarily all that bad? Edward Hallowell, for example, has done pretty well with ADHD, which he has never outgrown. Now in his late fifties, Hallowell struggled with the disorder as a child, as well as with dyslexia—there’s a large overlap between the two—but eventually became a strong student and went to Harvard. It’s a story much like Louis Strymish’s, and in fact, like Strymish, Hallowell found himself pulled into the book business. But not right away. He first took a small detour getting his medical degree and becoming a Harvard Medical School professor. When he did finally throw himself into books, it wasn’t as a bookseller, but as a bestselling writer of books on ADHD. His most recent, published in December 2005, is <em>Delivered from Distraction, </em>coauthored with John Ratey, a Harvard Medical School psychiatrist who also has ADHD.</p><p>Early in 2005, Hallowell and Ratey gave a talk at the public library in the small, prim bedroom community of Wellesley, Massachusetts. A standing-room-only crowd of about 150 people—apparently mostly the parents of children with ADHD—listened with what seemed a sort of desperate gratitude as the two men took turns describing how the disorder’s disorder, in spite of the heavy challenges it can present, can also be a real gift. “I wouldn’t trade my ADD for anything,” said Hallowell. “As far as I’m concerned, you all have attention surplus disorder.” He went on to describe the ADHD mind as “a Ferrari with Chevrolet brakes,” by which he meant that people with ADHD often seem to think more intensely and about more things than the rest of us, but with less control. “It shouldn’t be called a ‘deficit’ of attention,” he said. “It’s a <em>wandering</em> of attention.”</p><p>Until recently, and going back to antiquity, this messy form of thought was given what Hallowell calls a “moral diagnosis” of bad behavior and laziness, with a treatment plan that typically consisted of humiliation and beatings. But with tolerance and encouragement, he said, those with ADHD often turn out to be more creative and productive than others. (He himself lucked onto an unusually nurturing first-grade teacher.) As an example, he offered up David Neeleman, the CEO of JetBlue Airways, and an ADHD diagnosee with whom Hallowell has worked. Hallowell said Neeleman told him how his distraction had caused him to keep forgetting to bring in a tree surgeon to take care of a tree growing up against his house—until finally he sold the house, saying it was easier to arrange. That unpredictable and somewhat boldly erratic thinking style also led Neeleman to invent ticketless travel and a novel reservation system that allows agents to handle customer calls from their homes.</p><p>Part of the reason ADHD’s mental messiness isn’t always pathological is that there’s a less-appreciated flip side to ADHD, namely a tendency to have that wandering focus sometimes latch on to a particular task or idea. This “hyperfocus” sets up a sort of scan-and-lock mode of thinking, in that someone with ADHD sometimes furiously samples various aspects of the world around her, suddenly zooming in on whatever seems most engaging. That can be a highly productive approach to solving a problem—though it is not without its own problems. Denslow Brown says some of her ADHD clients sometimes grab on to a single task at work with such tenaciousness that they’ll miss meetings, leading her to recommend that they set loud-ringing timers in front of them. Hallowell related the story of one patient of his, a poet who was making ends meet by driving a school bus. The man once drove his entire route without remembering to stop and let any of the small children off the bus—but he was able to make considerable progress on a poem he had been thinking about all the while.</p><p>Sometimes the mess associated with a psychiatric disorder, while not necessarily helpful, can at least be considerably less pathological in its impact than one might expect. One fellow who suffers from Tourette’s syndrome, complete with its bouts of irrepressible tics, relates that the affliction is a complete nonissue in his job as a trader on the frenzied floor of a major exchange, where hundreds of other traders are constantly barking and twitching in the normal courses of their jobs. He doesn’t even feel the need to suppress the occasional random urge to shout Tourette’s-fueled obscenities at his colleagues; when he curses someone out, he explains, the colleague will blithely swear back at him, and that’s that, with no hard feelings.</p><p>Autism, in some of its incarnations, is an interesting example of how mess can be both problematic and helpful in the context of a psychiatric disorder. For some autistic children, the troublesome mess isn’t in their head, it’s in the world around them—they often crave order, consistency, and predictability, and if they don’t get it they can become highly agitated. One therapist tells of an autistic preschooler who enjoys going to the gym in his school—as long as he always goes with the same group, at the same time, and gets to stand on the same side of the gym; otherwise, he becomes inconsolably distraught. And yet according to a leading school of thought in the treatment of autistic children, one pioneered by George Washington University Medical School psychiatrist Stanley Greenspan, <em>increasing</em> the disorder in autistic children’s environments can be a key to helping them. The approach centers on a technique called <em>floor time,</em> in which a parent, teacher, or other caregiver insists on joining the child’s normally solitary play, making a point of gently disrupting whatever order the child tries to establish—flipping over a toy car that’s part of a neat line of identically arranged cars, pulling the child’s chair away from the table, changing a tape the child plays repeatedly, removing a piece of a puzzle. The intention is both to provoke an interaction between the child and the caregiver, building social and communication skills, and to create a problem that the child wants to solve, sharpening his cognitive abilities.</p><p>In the previous chapter we learned of some researchers who hope noise might somehow be inserted into the human brain as a form of treatment. Actually, one could say that crude forms of induced brain mess have been employed for decades, often highly effectively. The most prominent example is electroconvulsive therapy, popularly called electroshock therapy, in which an electric shock applied to the skull essentially forces a seizure and, speaking very roughly, scrambles the patient’s thought patterns. Though presumed by much of the public to be a violent, almost barbaric treatment, ECT today is widely used—about one hundred thousand patients receive it every year—and is considered by most experts to be fairly benign, though there is still some debate over possible memory loss and mild cognitive impairment. While it is generally a last line of treatment, it is more effective than any other approach against chronic, severe depression, and is also often helpful with some types of schizophrenia and with bipolar disorder. A Mayo Clinic study found that 91 percent of patients who received ECT said they were glad to have had it—an unusually high rate of satisfaction for a mental health treatment, and all the more extraordinary for coming from a group that is by definition difficult to treat, not to mention normally downbeat.</p><p class="h1">The Relativity of Mess</p><p class="p1">While scientists can sometimes measure disorder according to objective, technical criteria, our everyday assessment of what makes for an unpleasant mess and what doesn’t must be attributed to a vaguer and more subjective process. In many cases, our perception of disruptive mess is an entirely psychological construct. Consider, for example, that the consumer who returns a stereo to an electronics store because its musical output is marred by a deeply irritating background hiss might use his store credit to purchase a “sleep machine” that generates much the same hiss for the purpose of soothing the way to peaceful slumber. Simply put, pathological mess often turns out to be in the mind of the beholder.</p><p>An interesting example of the relativity of mess can be found in France in La Hague, a popular resort area on the western tip of Normandy’s Cotentin Peninsula. La Hague is a pleasantly breezy region of stone-walled fields grazed by goats and cows, and of grassy dunes lining the ocean. In summer, tourist buses and pop-up tent trailers crowd the winding, hilly roads that lead to La Hague’s beaches. There’s plenty in the area other than the ocean to keep visitors busy, including restaurants that, along with many Parisian eateries, serve butter and cheese made from the milk of those goats and cows, and oysters plucked from the sands near those dunes. Visitors can also explore parks, chateaus, and botanical gardens. And if there’s time left over, they can take the popular tour of the world’s largest nuclear-waste-processing plant, located just up the hill and affording some of the loveliest views of the area.</p><p>Nuclear power has always been at least vaguely creepy to Americans, and worse than that since 1979. That’s when the popular film <em>The China Syndrome</em> hit a nerve with its dramatic, fictional account of a near-meltdown at a nuclear power plant, thanks in large part to the fact that, about a week after the movie’s opening, reactor 2 at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant obliged the film’s publicity machine by overheating and releasing radioactive steam over the Pennsylvania towns and farmland along the Susquehanna River. (No one was directly injured, though there are claims that the incident bumped up cancer rates in the area.) <em>Syndrome</em> star Jane Fonda was out stumping about the threat of nuclear power before the reactor had cooled, and though Fonda had some history of taking positions that would in retrospect seem embarrassing to everyone involved, the country by and large went along with this one and has hardly looked back. All orders for new nuclear plants were immediately canceled, and there hasn’t been another plant ordered in the United States since. Today, the face of the U.S. nuclear power industry is Homer Simpson’s, and nuclear waste is just about the scariest, most repulsive form of mess that Americans can conjure—even when it’s to be buried beneath a cubic mile of volcanic rock and soil in the middle of the desert, judging by the widespread opposition to the plans to store radioactive waste below Yucca Mountain in Nevada.</p><p>Not so in most of the rest of the world, and especially in China, Japan, and France. In France, where 75 percent of the electricity comes from nuclear power, schoolchildren in some parts of the country are more likely to have had a pleasant tour of the inside of a nuclear plant than to have visited the Eiffel Tower. Homes and farms lap right up to the edges of the plants, and warm water from the plants’ cooling systems is circulated through local greenhouses. At the pristine, bucolically situated La Hague facility, which sprawls over more than a square mile and lies close to a bustling village (Yucca Mountain’s nearest commercial neighbor is a brothel fifteen miles away), tourists can ogle the processes by which spent fuel from French plants, as well as that of five other countries, is separated into uranium and plutonium, both of which can be reused in plants as fuel, with about 3 percent of the original fuel stored on site as sealed waste in the form of a glasslike substance.</p><p>The French may have this one right. Not only do nuclear power plants produce energy more cheaply than do gas- and coal-burning plants, they also have better safety records (excluding grossly inadequate, old-line Soviet designs like that of the Chernobyl plant, which were known to be disasters waiting to happen). Furthermore, they have none of the conventional plants’ vast emissions of globally warming greenhouse gases, and they even release <em>less radioactivity</em> into the environment than coal-burning plants. (That’s right; coal is one of those slightly radioactive ordinary substances mentioned earlier.) So what’s the scarier mess? The thirty tons of highly shielded, recyclable or buriable waste generated by a nuclear power plant in a year? Or the eight million tons of ozone-eating carbon dioxide and fifty thousand tons of toxic sulfur dioxide spewed into the air each year by a conventional power plant? For once, it may be Americans who are clinging to the superfluous <em>interdit.</em></p><p>Advertising presents another example of the relativity of undesirable mess. Talk to almost anyone in the advertising business and it probably won’t be long before she mentions the “clutter” problem—the idea that the public is so awash in advertising pitches that it has mostly tuned them all out. But this is a simplistic interpretation. According to Eric Webber, a vice president at advertising agency GSD&amp;M, the problem isn’t necessarily that there’s too much advertising. It’s that advertising has been largely confined to traditional formats—TV ads, print ads, billboards, banners on Web pages—that are especially easy to tune out or to avoid altogether. Says Webber: “Advertising was built around ‘the Cleaver model’”—he’s referring to the fictional family in the late 1950s to early 1960s television show <em>Leave It to Beaver</em>—“which is based on the idea that dad is home at 5:30, dinner is at 6:00, you settle in to watch television that has a couple of channels to choose from, and you listen to whatever messages marketers wanted you to hear.” But the brain is masterful at ignoring repeated, predictable signals that aren’t of special interest, which is why the wailing and whooping of someone else’s 130-decibel car alarm just down the street rarely holds attention for more than a minute. Now advertisers are recognizing that to avoid being filtered out in the same way, they need to scatter around a broader variety of more attention-grabbing ads. For the advertising industry, the problem isn’t advertising clutter; it’s a <em>lack</em> of clutter.</p><p>Does the idea that advertisers want to work more advertising into your daily life strike you as a scary one? It should. Two-thirds of people surveyed in a Yankelovich study said they already feel “constantly bombarded” by ads, and 59 percent said the ads they see have little or no relevance to them. But this second figure is worth focusing on. Is it possible many of us might come to <em>like</em> advertising clutter if advertisements were customized to our interests? We’re all about to find out.</p><p>For example, a company called Massive has developed a technique for changing the ads embedded in the scenery of video games to match an individual player’s moves and preferences. In four Massachusetts Stop &amp; Shop supermarkets, an electronic tablet attached to the shopping cart asks for a swipe of the shopper’s loyalty card and in return provides a shopping list that the store’s computers have prepared based on the shopper’s past purchases—as well as popping up targeted electronic coupons when the shopper turns down the aisle with the featured product, pumping impulse buys. And a company called Mall Radio Network pipes music into malls, sticking in now-on-sale-at-RadioShack-on-level-two sorts of ads that can be tailored to where a listener is standing and to what’s selling or not selling in the stores. Soon toaster ovens and orange-juice cartons may be flashing ads at you as you walk by them in stores, thanks to new, cheap, ultrathin electronic displays recently brought out by Siemens. Taxi-top electronic messaging signs from a firm called Vert are tied to GPS location sensors, so that wherever a cab roams, it can pitch a nearby store or restaurant. General Motors has been experimenting with location-aware sponsored messages tied to its OnStar communications system. Smart Sign Media operates digital highway billboards that detect the radio stations playing in passing cars, and flash up client ads that best match the profiles of those stations’ listeners. Mobiltrak places car-radio-station-identifying sensors in the parking lots of retail clients. And Reactrix Systems makes a high-tech projector that can turn a sidewalk or restaurant floor into a crowd-raising interactive video-game-cum-advertisement. According to Reactrix CEO Michael Ribero, studies have shown that as many as 80 percent of the people who line up to interact with the Reactrix image can recall the sponsor days later, compared to 5 percent for prime-time television advertising.</p><p>Answer your cell phone—the future of advertising is calling. McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts are among the companies that have beamed coupons to the cell phones of Americans who have expressed interest in them, eliciting coupon-redemption rates as high as 17 percent, where a 3 percent rate is a blockbuster by ordinary standards. Mike Baker, president of Boston-based mobile-marketing firm Enpocket, which ran the Dunkin’ Donuts campaign, notes there are already more mobile phones in use worldwide than televisions and computers combined. Throw in location tracking, a capability U.S. mobile phones are getting right now, and you’ve got a device that can prompt you with a coupon for a discount oil change just as you’re driving by the lube shop. Enpocket has already run such a “location-aware” mobile-phone campaign in Singapore on behalf of Intel.</p><p>Who knows where people will be most receptive to an ad? According to a 2004 AOL survey, 4 percent of Internet users have checked their e-mail on a portable device while in the bathroom. Perhaps some day, ads will be targeted accordingly. It might be an appropriate time, for example, to pitch a weekend at the nuclear waste resort.</p></div></body></html>
