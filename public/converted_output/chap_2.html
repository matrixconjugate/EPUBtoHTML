A Fortune 500 CEO or a U.S. senator posing in front of a desk surface obliterated by heaps of paper would risk being judged ineffective and undisciplined. If nothing else, the failure to keep a neat desk suggests vague, non-leadership-compatible issues of character, in much the same way that divorce did until about the 1970s.</p><p class="p3">To be sure, CEOs and senators usually have assistants to help them keep their desks clear. But in the worlds of business and government, at least, it’s not just people at the top who might feel pressured to maintain tidy desks. Organizational policy, written or unwritten, tends to be unfriendly to the cluttered desk. General Motors and United Parcel Service are among the many U.S. companies with formal “clean desk” policies; the <em>New York Times</em> is among those without one, but that wasn’t much comfort to staffers said to have been frostily instructed by former executive editor Howell Raines on the proper technique for stacking books on their desks. (Horizontally, in his opinion.) Some organizations go ahead and proudly spell out policies on their Web sites in black-and-white so the public can appreciate the pride employees take in being told what to do with their desktops. The following is excerpted from the “code of business conduct,” posted on the Web by Iowa-based bank First Federal Bankshares:</p><p class="ext1">Work areas should be kept neat and orderly. The Company must always look its best. Just as we are judged by our personal appearance, so is the Company. Good housekeeping makes it easier to organize your work, prevents loss of items, and provides a professional appearance. Excessive display of personal items is unprofessional. Supervisors and managers are expected to maintain a professional appearance in their departments and areas, and they may request that you remove items if they detract from a professional appearance. In addition, they may require you to clean or straighten your work area.</p><p>And these sorts of policies, whether formal or not, aren’t always just gentle suggestions. There’s no way of knowing how many times messy desks have played a role in hampering careers. But some institutions are explicit about the price of messiness. Bradford, Pennsylvania, fired its police chief for not having a neat desk. Australia’s postal service demoted an employee and fined her US$2,300 for refusing to remove from her desk a photograph of herself with friends—her fourth personal item, one more than the agency allows.</p><p>Fortunately for the world, Albert Einstein did not work for UPS or the city of Bradford. Einstein’s desk at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, was maintained, by all personal and photographic accounts, in stupendous disarray. (Einstein makes a good role model here not simply because he is so widely accepted as having been highly effective at his job, but also because, as we’ll soon see, Einstein might be regarded as a sort of godfather of the science of useful mess.)</p><p>In general, if one looks at organizations where people tend not to have neat-freak managers breathing down their necks—in other words, where they have a choice in the matter—people tend to have messy desks. Our survey backs this up, as do professional organizers. In particular, academia is an unrestrained haven of the messy work space, so much so that faculty at colleges and universities often behave as if they’ve been told their reputation will grow in direct proportion to the height of the piles on and around their desks. One Columbia University professor’s office has gradually become so densely packed with towers of papers and books that the school finally assigned him a second office so that students could meet with him in relative comfort and safety. When Nobel laureate and University of Chicago economics professor Robert Fogel found his desk becoming massively piled, he simply installed a second desk behind him that now competes in towering clutter with the first. His colleague at the school, chemist Stephen Berry, a recipient of a MacArthur “genius grant” award, works among a landscape of eighteen-inch-high piles that have harbored individual documents for as long as two decades.</p><p>Well, perhaps messy desks are the stuff of cranky genius. Maybe these folks would have been even more productive if they had followed conventional get-organized wisdom and sought out the promised time-saving efficiency and functionality of neat desks. Except when people study working efficiency—as did, for example, husband-and-wife Microsoft senior researchers Abigail Sellen and Richard Harper, authors of <em>The Myth of the Paperless Office</em>—they tend to find that messy desks can offer extremely functional environments. Academic types defending the practices of academic types? Actually, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out why it makes perfect sense to keep a messy desk.</p><p>First, there’s the cost of maintaining a neat desk. To keep a desk surface free of papers, except perhaps for small “in” and “out” piles, you have to get most incoming documents either filed away, thrown out, or handed off to someone else. (Let’s assume you’re not just shuffling them off into other piles on your floor or in your closet, since that would hardly be getting organized.) You can stick them into files in a filing cabinet, which would look pretty neat. But it takes time to read through and appropriately file each document if you want to be able to access it when you need it and if you want to be able to keep track of which documents are associated with what incomplete tasks and what sorts of deadlines.</p><p>In addition, you’ll spend time each day searching through files, struggling in some cases to figure out where you filed a document and which documents need immediate attention. (We’ll be talking later on about the difficulties that filing systems can cause in retrieving documents, but here’s a quick example: if you have a higher-priority item and a lower-priority item relating to, say, the same client, should you file them together in a single client folder or separately in more-urgent and less-urgent folders?) If and when you find the right documents, you’ll pull them out and shuffle them back onto your desk so you can work with them and then later will refile them. How much time you spend on your filing and retrieving each day will vary wildly with work complexity and the volume and types of documents you receive, but whatever it amounts to, it’s time you’ll be taking away from your real work.</p><p>Or you could follow the advice of many professional organizers and adhere to a “one-touch” policy for documents: whatever task is associated with the document, do it right away, so you can file it and forget it, chuck it, or pass it along. It certainly sounds like a good idea to go ahead and get the work done as it comes in, since you have to get it done sooner or later anyway. Except, of course, that you really don’t have to get all the work that comes to your desk done; a lot of it will eventually prove safely ignorable. What’s more, some of it will be of much higher priority than the rest. But under a strict one-touch system, you’ll find yourself spending time dealing with office-supply forms and seminar flyers, even when that career-making-or-breaking report to the managers is due in three days. Of course, you don’t necessarily have to be rigid about the one-touch system. Surely it’s no problem if you take some of the less-important documents and place them at a corner of your desk until the report is done. And even though that other document is pretty important, you don’t have to deal with it right this second and interrupt your thoughts, so you just slide it over there and...uh-oh.</p><p>A messy desk can be a highly effective prioritizing and accessing system. People with messy desks enlist any number of different strategies, often unconsciously, for keeping the work they need at hand. In general, on a messy desk, the more important, more urgent work tends to stay close by and near the top of the clutter, while the safely ignorable stuff tends to get buried at the bottom or near the back, which makes perfect sense. And yes, you’ll spend a certain amount of time rooting through the piles to find documents. This is where professional organizers claim you’ll lose anywhere from an hour a week to an hour a day. But, in fact, as long as the mess is kept to a reasonable level, you’ll probably do better time-wise than you would with a neat desk. First of all, the documents you most need will tend to be at hand anyway. According to our survey, people who said they keep a “very neat” desk spend an average of 36 percent <em>more</em> time looking for things at work than people who said they keep a “fairly messy” desk. And that figure doesn’t take into account how much additional time those with neat desks spend sorting and filing, or processing low-priority documents, in order to keep their desks so neat.</p><p>The various piles on a messy desk can represent a surprisingly sophisticated informal filing system that offers far more efficiency and flexibility than a filing cabinet could possibly provide. Messy desk owners typically, for example, have separate piles for urgent, less-urgent, and nonurgent documents. Within any one of those piles, you could keep together documents relating to, say, the same client. If you want to draw special attention to a document within the pile, you can displace it or turn it so it sticks out. If a document could reasonably go into either of two piles, you can place it so it straddles both piles. If you have to find a document, you can track it down not only by urgency and client but also by how long it’s been since you last saw the document and by what other documents came in around the same time, since the older, less-handled stuff is likely to be together closer to the bottom. If you keep a messy desk, some of these strategies probably sound familiar, though you may never have thought about the method to your clutter. And, as Sellen and Harper have pointed out, that’s one of the great characteristics of a messy desk: it will tend to naturally reflect the way you think and work. Thought and work are unpredictable, varying, and ambiguous. They’re messy. Why shouldn’t your desk be messy, too?</p><p>And a few more advantages. How many times have you waded through a pile of papers on your desk to look for a particular document only to stumble on a different one, which inspires you to accomplish an even more important task than the one you had originally intended—a task you would never have gotten to if you had filed that document safely away in a drawer? Even more satisfying can be the experience of coming across something in a pile that rings a bell with regard to something else you saw on your desk a few minutes ago, or in the previous day’s rummaging, facilitating a useful connection.</p><p>That’s what happened to Leon Heppel, a biomolecular researcher at the National Institutes of Health in the 1950s. Heppel was notorious among his fellow researchers for the clutter on his desk, which he would occasionally cover with a sheet of brown butcher paper so he would have a clean surface on which to deposit a new layer of clutter. One day, he came across a letter sent to him by researcher Earl Sutherland, describing Sutherland’s recent work with an unusual biomolecule and its effect on cells. Later, digging through wrapper levels, Heppel came across a letter that had been sent to him earlier on by the researcher David Lipkin, in which Lipkin described the action of a different biomolecule. Regarding the two letters side by side, Heppel realized his two colleagues were very likely describing different ends of the same cellular process. He forwarded Sutherland’s letter to Lipkin and Lipkin’s to Sutherland, setting off a chain reaction of insights that ended with Sutherland’s Nobel Prize–winning discovery of how hormones regulate cells.</p><p class="spb">Perhaps all of this helps to explain why, according to a survey conducted by professional staffing firm Ajilon Office, office messiness tends to increase sharply with increasing education, increasing salary, and increasing experience.</p><p>More than one professional organizer commented at the NAPO conference that the right attitudes about organization ought to be taught in elementary school. Good idea. An excellent example emerged from a recent visit to a fifth-grade public school class boasting rows of pristine desks and a spotless floor space, all unmarred by even a hint of clutter, except for one desk near the back of the room that had a teetering pile of clutter on the floor beside it. When asked about the pile, the teacher laughed and explained that she has a rule: the students can keep anything they want at their desks, as long as it all fits inside their desks at the end of the day. But every day one student seemed to fall short of the goal by about a seven-inch stack—he always had a few extra books, a pile of art in progress, several puzzles, and more. A daily struggle between teacher and student ensued, until after a few weeks the teacher had an epiphany. “I realized this wasn’t about discipline,” she said. “It was about curiosity. He just found all this stuff really interesting. And why are these kids here? To be neat? Or to be stimulated? I told him he could keep the extra things in a pile by his desk, and we haven’t had a problem since.”</p><p class="h1">Lawn Order</p><p class="p1">Kathleen Manton-Jones and her then-four-year-old daughter Grace moved to Winterhaven, a subdivision of Tucson, in 1997. A community of about 235 small homes comfortably spaced along broad, flat streets, Winterhaven is best known in Greater Tucson for placing itself on display to throngs of touring onlookers for two weeks every year around Christmas, during which time about four out of five Winterhaven homeowners take the trouble to deck out their houses in vast arrays of holiday lights. While not quite so self-consciously festive the rest of the year, Winterhaven is a community where most residents can walk for several blocks and expect to be hailed by friendly neighbors at every turn.</p><p>But for the past few years Manton-Jones has been gathering fewer neighborly waves and more than a few glares when she’s out for a stroll. Some of her fellow Winterhavenites have gone out of their way to confront her. One day her daughter, nine years old at the time, ran to answer the doorbell, and Manton-Jones heard a man speaking loudly and angrily. She came to the door and found a large, red-faced man in a suit trying to force a document into the hands of the terrified girl. Later, another man told Manton-Jones, at the end of a pointed finger, “Maybe you just don’t belong in Winterhaven.” Another accused her of single-handedly driving down property values in the community. Several simply wouldn’t speak to her. Then Winterhaven’s board of directors—technically, the community is a corporation—started heaping fines on her. The board went on to threaten to place a lien on her home.</p><p>It’s hard to picture Manton-Jones raising this sort of ire in any community, let alone one as seemingly as innocuous Winterhaven. She is slightly shy but quickly becomes relaxed and unleashes an easy laugh. A former marathoner with a neat veil of dark hair, she is an artist who makes ends meet by holding down a clerical job at a local community college. Her daughter is like any eleven-year-old, and her husband is a trim, quiet fellow with a steady grin. For the past decade her passion has been landscaping, having first fallen in love with lush, free-flowing gardens she saw in Europe and South America during her former husband’s tours of duty in the military, and then even more so with the staggering variety of hardy, colorful desert grasses, flowers, and shrubs she encountered in Texas.</p><p>As it happens, it was Manton-Jones’s landscaping interests that landed her in trouble in Winterhaven. Specifically, her affront to the community is having replaced most of her neat, plain green lawn—a form of plant life ecologically and historically alien to the region—with a more natural, varied, and water-thrifty landscape of indigenous flowers, grasses, and shrubs. She quickly found out that the residents of Winterhaven are, by and large, emotionally, politically, and, to hear them tell it, legally committed to having neatly trimmed green grass and little else surrounding the homes in their community.</p><p>If any one thing could epitomize our obsession with the neat and orderly, it might be the close-cropped grass lawn. An early-twentieth-century invention initially made popular by wealthy homeowners eager to bask in the hip gentility then associated with badminton, lawn tennis, and croquet, lawns require a staggering amount of care to achieve the ideal look of a flat, monotone tarp. Americans lavish $8 billion a year in products and services on them and pour fifty million pounds of pesticides and manufactured fertilizers over them, making the flying of tiny yellow “hazardous to children and pets” flags a familiar sight, and leading many experts to refer to them as “chemical lawns.” Suburbs are often not the havens of peace and quiet they are made out to be, if for no other reason than that they are literally abuzz with the growling and whining of the lawn mowers, weed whackers, edgers, and leaf blowers required to keep lawns tidy.</p><p>Aside from all the maintenance they require, lawns are ecological disasters. Closely trimmed grass has short roots and doesn’t hold moisture well. That means, for one thing, that grass tends to croak when not regularly watered; the watering costs for a fifty-foot-by-fifty-foot lawn can add nearly $100 per month to a Boston-area water and sewer bill, for example. It also means that heavy rain doesn’t readily soak into the soil, leading to runoff and attendant problems with flooding, erosion, and the distribution of the pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals needed to avoid the dreaded sparse lawn or green-brown patches. Grass offers almost nothing of use to birds and other normally welcome wildlife.</p><p>The problem isn’t simply that the vast majority of us have become conditioned to embrace the neatness and order of tidy lawns or even that we ignore the significant drawbacks to them. It’s that so many people react in horror when a neighbor explores a less ordered, if more sensible, alternative. Since 1990, the U.S. Congress has required that a quarter of landscaping budgets for federal highways go to plant native wildflowers, yet a homeowner who would be tempted to pull the car over to admire just such a magnificent, messy, untrimmed wildflower meadow might spit out his morning coffee if he looked out the kitchen window to see the same meadow sprouting up across the street where neatly mowed grass used to be. Natural landscapes may be beautiful, unique, nearly maintenance-free, and environmentally friendly, but their patchy, brushy, multiheighted, multicolored, and altogether disorderly look drives some communities nuts.</p><p>You’d expect natural landscaping to be an easier sell in the Tucson area, which is in the Sonoran Desert and receives an annual rainfall of twelve inches, often leaving only recycled wastewater running in its aquifers. Sure enough, local government has little interest in seeing large quantities of water diverted to lawn sprinklers and has actively promoted natural landscaping with considerable success—one of the few large communities in the United States to do so. To a visitor, the absence of grass is initially jarring, but the astounding multihued variety of flowering cacti, shrubs, and wildflowers displayed in its place quickly becomes enchanting. At times, the impression isn’t so much of landscaped lots as of a sprawling desert garden onto which low-cast, earth-toned homes have been discreetly placed as an afterthought.</p><p>But even here there are plenty of fanatical holdouts. Some two hundred of them live in Winterhaven. Though Tucson’s water rates can climb to five times those in wetter parts of the country, discouraging lawn watering, for historical reasons Winterhaven’s water sources aren’t subject to the city’s control, and Winterhaven provides its residents with all the water they want for a flat rate of $48.50 a month. In other words, they grow lawns largely because they can.</p><p>On a stroll through the surrounding neighborhoods, Manton-Jones points out some of the alternatives that the community finds more palatable than natural landscaping. A few yards are mostly baked dirt. Another consists of a large bed of pebbles, and one is entirely bricked in. None of these yards has offended the community enough to inspire fines or threats; after all, they may not be pretty or alive, but they are neat and orderly. Continuing along occasionally requires detouring around filthy puddles taking up half the street, formed by runoff from sprinklers, and in some spots the asphalt is rippled and torn from being frequently submerged—a strange problem in a desert city. We also pass a house with natural landscaping. The owner of this home had quietly paid his fines, later expressing his feelings in the form of a large metal sculpture in his front yard on top of which sits a lawn mower, extending upward like a middle finger.</p><p>Bret Rappaport smiles ruefully when he’s told of Kathleen Manton-Jones’s plight. He has heard this sort of story all too many times. Rappaport’s day job is lawyering at a classy twenty-seventh-floor office in a downtown Chicago law firm, where he represents the interests of well-heeled business clients. He doesn’t quite look or act the part; he is lumbering, loose-limbed, and broad-featured, and manages to come off as a little scruffy even in a nice suit. An inveterate camper and hiker, Rappaport in the early 1990s ended up representing, pro bono, five Chicago residents with natural landscaping who were being threatened with prosecution under the city’s “weed laws.” Intended to keep homeowners from letting grass lawns go to pot, weed laws are often wielded against natural landscapers by communities offended by the unlawnlike, untrimmed disorder. An extreme example is that of a former resident of the Buffalo, New York, suburb of Kenmore, who in 1984 was hit with fines of $30,000 for refusing to raze a twenty-foot-by-twenty-foot patch planted with a dozen different species of wildflowers. “It just didn’t have that manicured look of the neighbors’ yards,” he reportedly said at the time. On appeal to a state court, the fine was eventually reduced to $100, but death threats and gunfire from irate townspeople ensued, and one day, while the owner was away, the plot was mowed down by a neighbor, against whom charges were quickly dismissed.</p><p>Prosecutions continue today, as for example in the case of a woman in the St. Louis suburb of Florissant, who lost her 2005 jury trial in county court to keep her natural landscaping. But Rappaport rarely gets involved in legal battles now. He sees himself as more of a botanical diplomat, trying to help natural landscapers avoid controversy by greasing their communities’ transitions to floral tolerance. Surrounding his own home in the town of Deerfield, forty-five minutes north of Chicago, is a varied, colorful prairie landscape in miniature, composed of native grasses and flowers such as little bluestem, Solomon’s seal, and trillium, as well as rye and sideoats grama. The landscaping encompasses a tiny pond, and a small, sparse stand of trees crosshatched by a few trees that have fallen, left as shelter for animals, and now bearing small signs DO NOT DISTURB—WILDLIFE TREE. It’s lovely. And it requires no watering, chemicals, trimming, or reseeding. (Rappaport burns small patches of it each year in imitation of nature’s technique for managing growth and renewing the soil.)</p><p>There is also some conventional grass around the landscaping. It’s a key component, along with a lot of explaining, to heading off neighborhood objections, Rappaport says. If a natural landscape—even a dense, free-form one jammed with a dozen or more species that range and soar in random-looking patches—is surrounded by a thin, neat strip of lawn, then it’s usually better tolerated by the lawn-happy. That’s because the landscaping then tends to be seen, almost like an optical illusion, as a specialized garden within a lawn, even though the lawn’s square footage is dwarfed by that of the natural landscape. “If you throw paint on a wall it’s vandalism,” says Rappaport. “If you put a frame around the splotch, it’s art. People just need to see that sense of order and intent.”</p><p>Almost all of his neighbors continue to keep neat lawns. He points out the consequences: heavy erosion and silt deposits by the street’s several culverts, through which rain runoff from the lawns rushes as if from a cannon. The runoff, he says, joined with that of other heavily lawned Midwestern communities, carries silt and toxins and occasionally causes flooding downstream all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. “Today the Gulf is dead, dead, dead,” he says. But his neighbors have been fairly tolerant, at least, of Rappaport’s lawn alternative. And down the street, Patty Glicksberg and her family have followed Rappaport’s example and replaced much of their own lawn with prairie landscape. “I started off with a computer diagram of how the different wildflowers would be arranged in a nice, neat mosaic, so that I’d get the perfect combination of colors every season,” Glicksberg explains. “Then [Bret’s wife] Jina told me one of the flowers I was planting only came up every other year, throwing my whole scheme off. I freaked out. But finally I relaxed and decided you just need to let this stuff do what it’s going to do, and that’s what’s most beautiful about it.”</p><p>Back at his Chicago office, Rappaport concedes that he and other proponents of natural landscaping haven’t made great inroads into the nation’s obsession with fastidious lawns—replacing lawns with Astroturf and the like is a faster-growing trend. But he savors the small victories. Walking to the large office window, he indicates city hall, where administrators once plotted the prosecution of natural landscapers, and points out a variegated patch alongside the building. “It’s a prairie landscape,” he says. “It’s the best thing about my office.”</p><p class="h1">Corporations’ Big Plans</p><p class="p1">Each year, the top graduates of prestigious business schools are snatched up by management consulting firms such as McKinsey, Bain, and the Boston Consulting Group, which specialize most prominently in helping companies strategize. It might seem surprising that business school superstars, as a rule, don’t end up running companies, but they don’t; they’re more likely to end up giving advice to those who run companies, particularly advice on what new high-level strategies the companies should adopt. Well over twice as many 2005 Harvard Business School graduates went into consulting as into general management. (In fact, running companies tends to be a distant third choice of top business school graduates, behind consulting and financial services.) Not only is the pay typically better at top consulting firms than in industry, but there is, in theory, an opportunity to have far more impact. A management consultant can have a shot at setting the directions of many companies, instead of just one, and all without necessarily having to sweat the less intoxicating details involved in implementing the strategies or sticking around to see if they work and paying the price if they don’t.</p><p>Bill Starbuck—no relation to the coffee shop—could fairly be considered part of the management consulting industry, although in a more meta sort of way, in that he doesn’t simply perform strategic planning so much as analyze the process and impact of strategic planning. Like many in the strategic planning field, he entered this rarefied world through the academic side, as one of the many business school professors who consult to companies. And so it was that the strategic planning unit of France Telecom hired Starbuck to come and share his thinking. The executives in the unit could have reasonably imagined they’d be getting an active, highly competent mind: Starbuck is a storied New York University professor with an endowed chair, a former president of the Academy of Management, and an editor at one time or another of seventeen different professional journals. And if the France Telecom managers didn’t know it ahead of time, it was clear at the first sight of Starbuck’s solid bulk, shaved head, and laser gaze that they would be getting a no-punches-pulled take on things as well.</p><p>Even so, they did not expect Starbuck to tell them, along with all the senior executives of the company, that they were deadwood. In fact, minutes into the presentation the entire audience was, as the French like to say, <em>bouche bée</em>—that is, open-mouthed in unpleasant surprise. It was nothing personal. Starbuck didn’t mean to suggest that the France Telecom strategic planners in particular were useless. This highly respected expert on corporate strategic planning was simply insisting that corporate strategic planning in general, along with other forms of long-range, formal planning, is a waste of time.</p><p>Was “Indiana” Starbuck, as he sometimes refers to himself, simply struggling to live up to his hard-earned reputation for iconoclasm? This seventy-something former cat breeder, software developer, and free-spirit polymath, who has been active in the fields of sociology, psychology, and mathematics, among others, and with the current official title “professor of creative management,” openly boasts of occasionally making statements he knows to be untrue just to “confound” the people around him.</p><p>If Starbuck can’t resist slinging it once in a while, his charge that formal planning is useless is surely among his most suspect pronouncements. Formal strategic planning, once the domain of the military, became a big deal at corporations in the 1950s and has remained so continuously, except for a period in the 1980s when it fell out of favor as a reaction to an overobsession with it in the 1970s. Today, senior executives at most major organizations consider strategic planning to be not only part of their job description but also one of their highest callings. Former General Electric chairman Jack Welch, for example, held annual retreats with each of his unit heads for strategic planning sessions. Simple common sense alone might dictate that high-level, long-term, formal planning is essential for an organization’s survival, not to mention its ability to flourish. Strategic planning is how companies figure out what they’re going to be when they grow up—that is, which goods and services they’re going to offer in the coming years, and how they’re going to organize themselves so as to do it more effectively than their competitors. A company that didn’t engage in formal, high-level planning would be improvising, reacting, guessing—zigging here, then zagging there, instead of forging ahead along a carefully laid-out path. It would end up behaving in a very messy fashion.</p><p>It’s not as if no one had ever examined the value of formal planning. Numerous studies have demonstrated that strategic planning works. Except that when Starbuck reviewed them, he found the studies typically involved interviewing senior managers to ascertain how useful they thought their strategic planning was. And what do you know? Strategic planners tended to find their strategic planning <em>very</em> useful. For a more objective assessment, Starbuck reviewed data on how a corporation’s profits fared as compared to the amount of strategic planning the company had engaged in. The results: companies that did a lot of strategic planning performed, on average, no better than companies that did less strategic planning.</p><p>Not only does Starbuck see no surprise in that finding, he argues that it would be a miracle if it were otherwise. The main reason, in a nutshell, is that managers import a raft of poor assumptions into the planning process. For starters, says Starbuck, senior managers tend to badly misperceive their markets, their industries, and even their own organizations. Studies back him up. When senior managers were asked even the most basic questions relating to their areas of responsibility, they tended to fumble embarrassingly. In one study, corporate heads of finance were asked to estimate their companies’ sales volumes over the past five years; 60 percent of them couldn’t come close. Managers did about as poorly estimating most other facets of their corporation’s performance and capabilities, as well as the salient characteristics of their competitors and of potential customers. The one question managers consistently aced was that of whether the companies they worked for were large or small—anything more complicated was hit or miss. “The perceptions of executives are usually terribly wrong,” says Starbuck. “Sometimes it’s truly ludicrous.” Even managers at the scale of global politics seem clueless when it comes to characterizing their own domains, notes Starbuck, recalling that U.S. secretary of defense Robert McNamara repeatedly declared the Vietnam war to be going well in the mid-1960s, and that Joseph Stalin once named “gaiety” as the Soviet Union’s outstanding quality. More recently, the phrase “mission accomplished” returned to haunt the White House with regard to Iraq.</p><p>The misperceptions tend to emerge from the very structure of organizations, says Starbuck. Because assessments have to be communicated up and down an organization, and because managers’ standings can rise with positive assessments and fall with negative ones, the process tends to produce oversimplified assessments that are spun to emphasize the positive. Managers tempted to speak out against these distortions fear they’ll be seen as pessimistic troublemakers. What’s more, managers tend to hew to the outlooks espoused by their bosses, so that when senior managers—who are typically too far removed from the front lines to observe directly what’s happening at their own organizations, never mind the world outside—ask for input from their subordinates, they end up hearing “echoes of their own voices,” as Starbuck puts it. The distortion becomes even worse in strategic planning, where the need to come up with and justify specific plans leads managers to further massage data to fit a scheme, and later observations are likewise massaged to make the plans appear to have worked. The result is a vicious cycle of bad perceptions engendering bad plans that lead to worse perceptions, and so on.</p><p>Even if managers had terrific information about their companies, industries, and markets, long-range formal planning would still be doomed, argues Starbuck. That’s because business-world predictions going out more than a few months might as well be coin flips. Customers and competitors behave in unforeseen ways, new trends emerge, politics take strange turns, nature lashes out—from the point of view of a team of managers sitting in a conference trying to read the future, the world behaves essentially randomly. IBM chairman Thomas Watson reportedly predicted in 1943 that the world market for computers would peak at the number five, and managers at corporations everywhere haven’t done all that much better since. In particular, people tend to downplay the likelihood of oncoming significant change in their universes. In one study, three-quarters of managers ended up underestimating the level of change that ultimately took place in their industries by two-thirds or more—that is, things changed three times as fast as managers had assumed they would. Only in a few staid, insulated industries, like casket manufacturing, do forecasters perform reasonably well with any consistency.</p><p>Managers needn’t feel embarrassed at their failure to read the future correctly. The U.S. government’s ultrasophisticated computer models for forecasting the economy hardly do much better. One study found that a technique of simply guessing that the gross national product will remain whatever it is right now for the next three months did better on average than three out of four of the government’s leading models. A technique of guessing that the GNP will change over the next three months exactly as much as it changed over the past three months did better than all four. Businesses, of course, rely heavily on the government’s models for their own strategic planning.</p><p>No one should be surprised that long-range plans based on a shaky grasp of the past and present and a wild stab at the future turn out not to be very helpful. But even if companies strategized with good information and predictions, says Starbuck, they’d still be wasting their time. That’s because while it takes months or years to implement strategies and get them rolling, competitors can pick up on a company’s strategic shifts almost immediately, and, if the strategies look promising, quickly imitate them. Even the obsessively secretive Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who has unhesitatingly wielded lawsuits against employees and Apple-friendly bloggers alike in an effort to suppress advance information of new products, has consistently failed to keep a lid on strategic moves, as, for example, when word of an embryonic iPod cell phone leaked out some six months before the phone was introduced. And if competitors were slow to respond, it still wouldn’t matter, says Starbuck. The notion that a company will benefit by implementing new strategies well before its competitors do—the so-called first-mover advantage—has long since been discredited. Historically, companies that are slower to move into new types of products and services are more likely to do well than the companies that pave the way, as long as there aren’t billion-dollar infrastructure costs involved. (Monopolistic strategies are the exception, Starbuck notes, but, unfortunately for strategic planners, are illegal.) Google was inspired by the more senior, groundbreaking, and now obscure Alta Vista search engine, and the Oreo cookie was a bald-faced rip-off of the Sunshine Hydrox. “At best you just end up in a Red Queen’s race,” says Starbuck—that is, just running in place. Companies that instead rely on informal, shorter-term planning, says Starbuck, are in a good position to react profitably to unexpected shifts in the business environment, whether or not in imitation of a rival.</p><p>In fact, says Starbuck, long-range planning probably has an <em>adverse</em> effect. That’s because formal planning can end up locking companies into faulty strategies, focusing everyone’s energies on opportunities that never materialize, and causing companies to ignore real opportunities that spring up in their place. If you’re an automaker and your planning has led you to embark on long-term efforts to provide the world with more and bigger SUVs, you’ll be slower to pick up on the sudden interest in hybrid vehicles, and it will take you longer to do anything about it. According to the data, though, companies that are heavily committed to formal strategic planning don’t, on average, do worse than less-planful companies. No better, but no worse. One likely reason is that many companies tend to be quick to ignore their own planning—they make the plans, print them up as impressive documents in shiny binders, stick them on shelves, and then leave them there, because even imperfectly informed managers can recognize when plans aren’t likely to work out as, well, planned. In addition, it’s the biggest, most successful companies that are likely to have the extra resources to waste on greater levels of formal planning; they may indeed end up suffering from planning-induced profit shrinkage, but since they were better off to begin with, the effects may not be obvious when compared to other companies. In other words, when a company does well, it may have the confidence and extra money to engage in more formal planning, after which it does a little less well.</p><p>Despite the evidence that formal planning is at best useless, companies still rely on it. You might think the word would have gotten out on strategic planning. Of course, one way that shifts in management thinking propagate through the business world is via management consultants—like the ones who get hired to help with strategic planning. Maybe that’s why Starbuck doesn’t often get asked to speak to strategic planning groups anymore. Just ask the France Telecom strategic planning unit. Though you’d have to do some digging, because the group was disbanded not long after Starbuck spoke there.</p><p class="h1">Noisy Calls</p><p class="p1">If you’ve noticed that cell-phone conversations seem a great deal less garbled than they used to, you might want to know that part of the credit belongs to International Telecommunications Union recommendation G.711.II, which specifies a mathematical technique for dealing with cell-phone noise. Specifically, this technical standard applies to the essentially random background sounds picked up by a cell phone’s microphone—traffic hubbub, the conversations of passersby, the hiss of wind gusts, the tinkle and clatter of silverware in a restaurant, the drone of an air conditioner. Many engineers throughout the cell-phone-speaking world are well versed in employing G.711.II and similar techniques, and some companies even specialize in it.</p><p>Why worry about cell-phone noise? That may seem a silly question. As your average cell-phone-equipped nine-year-old might explain, background sounds can interfere with the conversation. Engineers might hasten to add that transmitting background sounds takes energy, which drains cell-phone batteries more quickly and hogs part of the limited and costly communication channel that could otherwise be applied to callers’ voices. In the world of communications, and in fact in all forms of information transmission, there is <em>signal</em>—that is, what we hope to distinguish and derive information from, generally a speaking voice in the case of a cell phone—and there is <em>noise,</em> which is most everything else, including background sounds. Noise is a form of mess. It would seem obvious that it is advantageous to neaten what ultimately comes through our phones by getting rid of as much background noise as possible.</p><p>Yet none of this would explain why recommendation G.711.II describes a means for <em>adding</em> background noise to cell-phone conversations. But it does. And the companies that operate cell-phone networks pay good money to have the noise put in.</p><p>Some of that money goes to a Montreal company called Octasic, for which the technique of adding background noise into cell-phone conversations is a core competence. Frédéric Bourget, a senior product manager at Octasic and something of an expert in background noise, explains that there’s a bit of a history to the relationship between phone networks and noise. Back before the 1990s and the rise of all-computerized phone networks, engineers working with both landlines and cell-phone networks had to wrestle with all sorts of noise, including the sizzle of electronic circuitry, the buzz of home wiring, the crackle of stray radio signals and sunspots, and the disconcertingly out-of-sync echo of the speaker’s own voice bouncing back and forth through the lines like an aural yo-yo. Remember when a call across the United States entailed having to speak up to be heard? That loss of volume over distance was a characteristic deliberately added to the long-distance network by AT&amp;T engineers, because as much as it squelched the speaker’s voice, it even further reduced the echo of the voice, allowing the shouting speaker to be heard clearly over the echo. But even with this and other tricks, cell-phone conversations of the 1970s and 1980s were often nightmares of electronic groans, pops, and whooshes.</p><p>As the phone networks went digital in the 1990s, transmitting voices as strings of 0s and 1s, all this electronic noise became relatively easy to clean up—a computer has little trouble differentiating between the 0s and 1s of a voice and those of a sunspot or between a voice and its echo. That left background sounds as the one remaining form of phone noise, and that was really only an issue with cell-phone conversations, which after all routinely take place on busy streets, in cafeterias, and at airports. Seeing an opportunity not only to eliminate this final distraction but also to conserve precious cell-phone battery life and channel capacity, engineers finally developed sophisticated computer techniques for stripping out the background cacophony and sending only the speaker’s voice. And during the pauses between speech, the network wouldn’t have to transmit <em>anything,</em> no matter what was going on in the background. Why take the trouble to pipe through the roar of a nearby lawn mower? The only thing the person on the other end needed to hear was the speaker’s voice, punctuated by glorious near-silence. What could be more agreeable? What could be more efficient? What could be neater?</p><p>Just one little problem: callers hated it. Specifically, the absence of background noise leads to three difficulties. First of all, the engineers hadn’t completely gotten rid of the voice echoes; they had merely suppressed them to the point where they couldn’t be noticed over the background noise. When the background noise is removed, the faint echoes can be made out again, and that turns out to be a big problem. Unlike background noise, which is random and messy, an echo is a type of <em>correlated noise</em>—its pattern follows that of the speaker’s voice, but is shifted in time. Our brains are good at ignoring a stream of random noise, but neater, correlated noise is highly distracting.</p><p>Second, background noise creates a sense of “presence.” It lets you know that the call is still connected, even if the person at the other end isn’t speaking at the moment. “We’ve been trained to hear small background noises in phone conversations,” Bourget explains. “Perfect silence sounds like a hang up. The background noise isn’t really just noise. It’s a form of information, providing feedback that someone is still there.” People who hear complete silence at any point during a phone conversation tend to interrupt the conversation with “Hello?” and “Are you still there?”</p><p>Finally, we don’t live in sealed containers. We live in a world where things that make noises are constantly near us, where in a sense even the space around us has a faint murmur to it. This noise feels right to us; at an unconscious level, it is reassuring. The technical term for this type of background noise, in fact, is <em>comfort noise</em>—engineers like Bourget call it <em>CN</em>—and trying to talk to someone in the absence of it is a bit disorienting and even a little creepy. Our brains rebel at the unnatural neatness.</p><p>The background noise had to come back. But engineers were loath to give up the battery life and channel capacity they had saved by eliminating its transmission. So they came up with a compromise. The background noise would still be stripped out, but it wouldn’t be entirely discarded. Instead it would be “sampled”—that is, a computer in the network would analyze it and pull out key characteristics, such as how often its pitch varied and by how much. These characteristics would then be transmitted to the other end of the network, where a computer would use a mathematical technique—G.711.II, for example—to reconstruct a simulation of the background noise and add it back in with the voice.</p><p>This tortuous-sounding trick fools listeners of cell-phone talkers everywhere just fine, even if it would never occur to them to appreciate it or even notice. It’s not a perfect solution, of course. Once in a while, background noise can be so excessive that a little creepy silence might be welcome. And there’s one type of background noise that trips up the technique: music on hold. When someone tries to speak over music on hold, the network assumes the music is noise, strips it out, and substitutes a simulated version, which, depending on the music, often comes out sounding something like a raspy wheeze. It would be a lot easier for companies like Octasic if doctors’ offices played random traffic and air-conditioner sounds to its cell-phone callers on hold.</p><p>On the other hand, maybe it’s only fair that music sometimes ends up as noise. After all, noise sometimes ends up as music. But that’s for another chapter.</p><p class="h1">The Bias Toward Neatness</p><p class="p1">Perhaps it’s not surprising that in a large world where countless trillions of events and situations unfold, we were able to find a few exceptional examples where neatness is pointless or even problematic, and mess plays a benign or even beneficial role. But trust us—we’re just getting warmed up.</p><p>That there is a heavy and somewhat blind bias toward neatness and organization is a little strange, considering all the negative associations so many of us have with highly ordered systems. Order reached a zenith of sorts, at least in Western civilization, with Nazi Germany. (What, in contrast, could be messier than the Garden of Eden?) Obsessive-compulsive disorder and some forms of autism are to an extent diseases of overorganization. The question, then, isn’t whether or not too much neatness and organization can be a problem. We all know it can. The question, rather, is where to draw the line. But oddly enough, it’s a question that hardly anyone asks. Most people simply assume they’re on the overly messy and disorganized side of the line and believe they would do well to drag themselves in the direction of neatness and order.</p><p>Let’s be clear on a few important points. First, it’s obvious that at a certain level mess becomes dysfunctional. We’re not saying that messier is always better. We’re not anarchists calling for the dissolution of national government, social order, and organizations. Burying oneself in extraneous clutter and operating without rhyme or reason quickly becomes paralyzing—those are examples of what we call <em>pathological mess,</em> about which we’ll have something to say later on. Some situations leave little room for mess; for example, nobody would want to go to a messy eye surgeon. Rather, we argue that there is an optimal level of mess for every aspect of every system. That is, in any situation there is a type and level of mess at which effectiveness is maximized, and our assertion is that people and organizations frequently err on the side of overorganization. In many cases, they can improve by increasing mess, if it’s done in the right way. At a minimum, recognizing the benefits of mess can be a major stress reducer—many of us are already operating at a more-or-less appropriate level of mess but labor under the mistaken belief that we’re failing in some way because of it.</p><p>Also, we are in no way saying that people should be slobs; a certain amount of cosmetic neatening—as with Bret Rappaport’s framework of neatly trimmed lawn—can go a long way. Indeed, as you’ll see, we encourage it in many situations.</p><p class="spb">At the NAPO conference, Barry Izsak offered the observation that “disorganization is a human condition.” He meant it by way of reinforcing the notion that everyone needs help getting more organized. For us, it raises this question: if disorganization is a human condition, why do so many people rush to squash it wherever it pops up?</p><p>Now let’s take a look at how society got itself into this...situation.</p></div></body></html>
